Tomorrow, we should take the horses and a picnic lunch and ride up the mountain trail, for a swim in the river, Brianna suggested late one afternoon, a few days later.  I know of a nice spot next to a waterfall.

Brianna strapped the picnic basket to her horses saddle and said, Well ride down the beach this way, she pointed, as she mounted her horse.  Then well take the trail up into mountains to the river.

Finally, Brianna and Cassie reached the spot in the river with the waterfall that Brianna had mentioned earlier.

Mountains, with a waterfall and caves in the background, surrounded her.

Cassie climbed down the steps of the shuttle and stood on the beach, looking around at the charred rubble and the mountains and jungle off in the distance.  Brianna sure as hell didnt freeze to death here - thats for sure, said Cassie.  Man!

I can see mountains back over there, she said, pointing beyond the beach.  I bet thats where that stream and waterfall are.

Those mountains are surrounded by jungle.

Noticing that Jason had taken his eyes off of her, Cassie went running for the jungle, determined to go check out the mountains in the far distance.

I know the landmarks of the stream and the waterfall where I saw Brianna.

Finally, Pixie bounded up a large tree and looked around. That way, she pointed.  Pretty sure I could see the gap in the trees running along that way.

I stay quiet for fear of tipping her off the cliff edge she is on, then shed be gone and all of the work Ive put into Carl will be for nothing. Fuck, its hot down here. Are you close to the beach? Sally loves the beach. Yep.

One day, when the sun chose to shine upon this Scottish island, he followed her to the high cliffs that looked out across the ocean, which was quiet for the moment. Margaret, you are very beautiful.

Please leave me to enjoy the view by myself. Leave you Margaret; I have no intention of leaving you. Tulsan replied tersely. It would be very rude of me to ignore one as lovely as you. Tulsan grabbed the young woman and forced a kiss upon her lips, and fearing that Tulsan planned to go even further, she pushed him back and cried out in fear.

Horses not go down Big Drop. Rock could see that Willow was puzzled. Theres a long cliff somewhere ahead, he explained to her. Ive never been there, but Ive heard of it.

Too steep to grow crops and theres no grazing. Long ago, many stone listeners hunted there, before Harvesters built Forest Road, Young Timber added. After Big Drop is way to sea, and another way to reach Forest. As far as Rock knew, beyond the long cliff was a lot of windswept, salty, sandy land where few people could be bothered to settle.

The Wanderers chose a suitable camp site off the road, on the opposite side to the cliff.

There was a short stretch of stony land to cross before the cliff fell away more steeply.

Eventually, she realised it came from the Green, some of whom were already beginning to make their way down the cliff.

Were not going to get all the way down that cliff in one day. I see two of them have stayed behind for you, Rock observed.

Inside her head, Willow heard them express their intention to keep near Wildcat, ready to help her if she had trouble descending the cliff with only one useable arm.

The marsh girl was going to have to descend the cliff one-handed, and even her good arm had its still-healing skin dance scar.

Lower down, roots tracked like ropes along the cliff.

Following the direction of his gaze, Willow saw that grey-black clouds now filled the sky, all the way from the cliff behind to the horizon ahead.

Eventually, Willow could make out a long, low, moss-covered opening in the rocky side of the cliff.

Outside, the wind sang harshly, flinging rain against the cliff.

She was up on the road, he said, so we climbed all the way up that great cliff.

And then Hest said wed got to go down that salted cliff again, cause thats where youd gone now.

It started raining. Jorens tone was still grumpy. I said we should stop before we fell off the cliff and killed ourselves.

Nevertheless, Wildcat was furious with him, because Willow refused to continue travelling down the cliff until he came out of his talent.

With the exception of the two who were intending to stay close to Wildcat, the rest of the Green were now making their way further down the down the cliff.

They warned that the land beyond the cliff had no streams or rivers.

We know its going to be dry at the bottom of the cliff.

Making her way along the cliff side, Wildcat dodged beneath small trees and bushes to stay out of the worst of the rain.

After some time she made her way along the cliff alone, going as fast as she could, which was actually quite slowly on account of her arm.

Carefully making her way along the cliff, she was aware of the two Green close by.

She wanted to talk to the other Green, too, the larger group further down the cliff.

Eventually, she understood enough to work out they had come to the site of a recent landslide, caused by a rush of water down the cliff.

Those trees were now sliding down towards the foot of the cliff, but their roots would eventually anchor them, allowing them to grow in their new locations.

For the past moon, Hest had been studying the wild water that flowed over the cliff in this area.

Then the Green had talked to him of Willow, sending him up the cliff in search of her.

The road already interfered with the way rainfall ran over the cliff.

You mean if the Green hadnt called you here and you hadnt sent the water down the cliff somewhere else, we would have been washed away last night? Willow demanded of Hest.

Instead, she looked out at the cliff-side in silence for a while, thinking of her home village.

All five of them then looked out at the dripping cliff-side.

As soon as Wildcat returned, they would need to travel onwards down the cliff.

The Green obviously trusted him, and Joren as well. Are mudslides common on the Drop? she asked, returning to the worry that had first brought her to stand at the cave mouth. I think they are quite common after rain, yes, Hest replied. Water runs straight off the road above, then down the cliff.

So, with the cliff being so steep, water just goes straight over the edge.

But under the sand, rocks hide. Rocks guide the water to the sea, Hest confirmed. So that knife-happy girl outside is right, Joren spoke up suddenly. Collect water while you can get it if youre planning a journey below the cliff. Were you going somewhere else before the Green called Hest to help us? Willow asked then, addressing them both.

It felt wonderful to be in Hests company again, but she knew he must have been following some other path of his own. Not up the cliff, thats for certain, Joren replied. We were making for the Forest, just like you, only not in such a hurry.

Hest had th idea t study water flow near the cliff.

The Forest is just as much made up of water as its made of rocks and plants and creatures. So well travel there together then? Willow asked, looking from Hest to Joren. Or would you rather go back up the cliff and follow the road? Joren shrugged in a way that suggested he would go along with whatever Hest wanted.

Yes, youre right. They continued to make their way carefully down the rocky cliff. Heres another question, Rock said, after a while. Why is Joren going to the Forest if hes not talented?

The area nearest the cliff seemed cold and damp, even though no further rain had fallen.

Against the rocks, in the shade of the cliff, many ferns and a few flowering plants were growing.

Further away from the cliff, the ground looked increasingly dry.

He already seemed to have accepted a share of the responsibility for getting them back to the Forest. Theyre heading for the Great Road, I expect, he commented. Theyll climb the cliff and wait for a harvest run to come by.

New slate falls from that cliff all the time.

It would probably be like trying to read the sea when standing on top of a cliff at low tide. Dont, Rock, came a whisper from Neamis. We hide. But it... its not... Rock started to say.

That horse knew her way down that mountain even better than him.

Sprinting forward, Steve planted his foot dangerously close to the edge of the cliff where the cobblestone road dropped off into the moat.

With a face full of fear, he was standing at the edge of the cliff, right where Steve had been.

Even if he were only fifty, he still would have been winded from this mountain of a staircase.

He merely looked up at the prince and smirked as a waterfall of blood came out of his mouth.

Fredrick cackled when warned of the ease of confusing specimens of fox, coyote, wolf, bobcat, mountain lion, and badger dung.

Funny about you and your antique, hand-carved doors, which I have to admit right from the start no longer impress me. Ive learned from my years of dealing with the wealthy, you began that last afternoon in one of your fatigued voices, implying, disloyally, that for years your customers had plagued you, and that you, perched in a vast mansion at the boundary of a mountain bighorn preserve, were not in fact one of the wealthy yourself, its the front door that matters to the rich.

But the sad thing is that the Oodham who used to spend their summers there on the top of the mountain are now unable to hike their way to the top of the mountain.

I drifted away from these hats, to her window where I studied the craggy pink and gray mountains with their recent sprinkling of powdered sugar.

One day, while listening to a French cassette, the older sister drove their Mercedes, like a projectile, like an avenging black beetle, straight off a cliff.

So anyway, people say they want to see my dioramas against the background of the mountains and its just too darn hot out here in the summertime to hold anything outside.

The wrinkled old woman clambered onto the cliff ledge.

He rubbed his eyes and squinted, but the smooth cameline mountains in the distance faded like islands in the fog.

He tried to picture the last thing he saw: mountains like camels in the desert.

When he finally straightened his back, he breathed deep and peered at the mountains in the north.

He put down the broom and peered once more at the mountains in the distance, the slow curvatures across the sky.

They walked the Silk Road from end to end. Then, clamping Jins chin in his coarse grip, the old man twisted his face towards the mountains behind them and laughed insanely. Those are their camels still making their way home. Jin could still recall the giant rocky humps under the gray sky, one following the other, mossy in the morning mist.

When her father asked about the Japanese, he said hed always run off to the mountains before they arrived.

He pointed over her shoulder. Someone once told me that before mountains were mountains they were camels returning to their home. She turned her head.

We watch the plane rise above the tree-line and dissolve into the snow and sunshine that sketch the mountains peaks.

Maybe the weather is getting worse or there is an errant cargo handler on the runway; could a bomb threat have held all the planes in the sky, forcing them to fly around the city until they can safely spiral down from the mountains and over the sea and onto the river delta on which the airport sits? What if flying from Ireland is like the Bermuda Triangle?

Dropping my shorts to the floor, I tore off my sweaty T-shirt and pulled over my head a gorgeous, cotton knit dress in little rivulets of blue and green, like a mountain stream.

It turned out to be a busy summer, dancing with Cal, dipping my toes into standup comedy, hosting Air BnB guests, and fitting in as many mountain hikes as I could.

Here, where the mountains are so much larger than life, it seemed possible to believe I already had everything I needed to be happy.

As humans- Whether we're climbing a mountain spiritually, or preparing our Tao'co Salad physically, we are always adapting to the way.

Dozens of volcanoes continually erupted beyond the steep charred-black mountains that surrounded the castle.

The cliff stood tall and far from the huge, sprawling city of Kyrion.

The tension of the water fluttered when Jericho had driven his cursed sword into the bottom of the pond; the school of orange fish quickly dispersed and reformed their pack after the water became calm  the only exception being the far-end of the pond where the large waterfall was creating a constant stir in the pond.

With her right arm reeled all the way back and two fingers holding tension on the conjured string behind the heated arrow, she exhaled calmly and studied her target  a lone volcano that rested upon a mountain seven-hundred meters away.

When the sun was even higher in the sky, I could see far off, snow-capped mountains piercing the mist.

Author Website Original Ancient Erotica from the Bible 1 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead. 2 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them. 3 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within thy locks. 4 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury, whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty men. 5 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which feed among the lilies. 6 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense. 7 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and the rough places plain: And the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together (Isaiah 40:4-5).

This fact was declared in the Qur'an fourteen centuries ago: And your Sustainer has inspired the honey bee: "Prepare for yourself dwellings in mountains and in trees, and in what [men] build; and then eat of all manner of fruit, and find with skill the spacious paths of your Sustainer".

(Surat al-Qamar: 49) Not only human beings but also all things animate and inanimate, the sun, the moon, mountains and trees have their destinies determined by Allah.

The world beneath them harbored reddish patches of landscape scarred with rugged mountains that fanned across its surface, like snakes slithering across a hot desert.

So, for now, Freddy, be quiet so the rest of us can figure out which direction to go in tomorrow, said Erick condescendingly, driving Bryanna to look away shaking her head in disapproval at his remarks. Well, thats easy, said Dax, trying to minimize any tension building between Erick and Fred. So far, weve been walking towards the mountains with the sun to our backs.

That mountain peak thats been in front of us all day is our goal, suggested Dax. We should climb it to see whats out here. They all shook his or her head in silent agreement.

The mountain range loomed ahead of them with the dim sunlight of Rubius at their backs.

In front of them loomed the mountain range.

He was making good headway up the mountains rocky slope.

He waved down to the others to come up to join him on a small cliff.

From their vantage point, it appeared to go down into the mountain at a steep angle.

Ryan asked, Why didnt we notice it earlier? The way they angled the cave on the slope of this mountain makes it difficult to see from the ground, offered Dax. I think whats even more important is who made it. Say, youre right, said Ryan. It does look man-made, but I thought this planet was deserted. My thoughts exactly, replied Dax. Shall we investigate to see who is at home?

It poked a hole clean through the mountains rock to form the tunnel.

She saw the mountains a good distance behind her.

The royal wharf perhaps or a secluded cove along the cliff. Vythe stroked his chin, Perhaps, he nodded, I will only be able to tell by trying, but we should wait until night. I thought you be opposed to teleporting, to be honest, Lieut remarked curiously, Is the demon still not after you? Vythe shrugged, It seems not.

The two realms are joined by a narrow stretch of land covered in rocky mountains and sand.

By now it was dawn and Iner was just poking above the mountains to the east.

From their position the cliff top where the estates of the ruling Lords were built was in view, and rising into the clear morning was black smoke. Looks like Cardonian has already made his move, Tyfar remarked grimly. Thats not near my house though, Valianna said in surprise and concern. Lets go, Fairris said and headed off quickly, the others following close behind.

With a stretch of his back Kildar began to walk down the narrow path along the side of the mountain that led to the road into Lancer.

With Nanil beside him he headed to the castle that was built into the side of the cliff face of a tall grey peak.

To his left the land ascended gently to the castle which was built deep into the mountain side.

Only his quick reflexes saved him and hand shot out and somehow found a hold on the side of the cliff.

His tranced was suddenly broken as a great white dragon flew over the mountains before him and towards the north.

What would you think if he went to a mountain to hang around a certain magical tree?

A bottle of mountain dew and ice.

Sitting on a mountain of cash.

Dont leave me stranded on a cliff, Cliff.

Just go to sleep. Please dont leave me stranded here on a cliff, Cliff. Caution: She could quickly become trouble.

One saw large, green open spaces where a few deer and mountain lion might live in some symbiosis with the carrion-hungry condors circling above.

Anyway, new worlds in books were my escape, but Doctor Arnold Schiester is my hero. Tina says. Who is that? James asks. The man who became my mentor, surrogate father, and big brother all rolled into one. She smiles. He taught me about life, about helping people, making a difference, and learning, the thrill of climbing mountains in your mind to new peaks of greatness and perfection.

They approached the perimeter of the mountain after navigating a large area of bush. There she is, La Montana del Diablo.

Hopefully we wont have any company. As soon as Tina finished speaking, a pair of ferocious looking mountain lions came out from behind some rocks, and crossed their paths in the clearing. Uh oh, you spoke too soon. Tina uttered. They look hungry. says James. Hopefully not for us, Tina smirks.

Tina ran over to the other side of the mountain as the lions started closing in, growling.

With a quick thought looking above him, James dropped the sack and waved both his hands at the mountain above, and within seconds a single rock the size of a human head falls and strikes the lion attacking Tina,  and both lions run away as a barrage of similar rocks comes falling down atop them.

The heat from the baking sun and fire, soot, and smoke from the mountain top grew heavier as they ascended. As we ascend, there will be less oxygen.

They walk together to the edge of the clearing overlooking a cliff side. The view is breath-taking says James looking over the cliff side and the long way down into the trees. I have no more breath to take Tina joked.

They had walked several meters in when they came to a large cliff overlooking a pit and a chamber that rose up as they entered forming a circular enclosure with a solid metal door sealing tightly behind them.

The Protector lands on its perch and James and Tina disembark onto it then jump off of the perch and help one another up onto a cliff nearby, which overlooks the burning flow of hot molten lava below in the middle of the mountains violently active volcano.

And James, hanging like a thread from the upper level cliff with Tina on his back used all of his strength and grunted crawling up onto a flat area as the lava erupted.

Chapter 57 The winds blew over the small mountain overlooking the rolling hills, and the distant clouds foretold a major storm on the horizon, lightning and thunder beckoning amongst the treetops.

Within seconds the entire mountain started to shake, rocks fell from the sky, trembling noises rumbled above, and the mountaintop exploded in a brilliant blast as the gilded light permeated the air above them in a sudden flash, making the entire crew cover their masks faces at the intense brightness.

They looks up in awe at it as they exit the cave and saw it fly over them and head towards the town. What incredible power. Juan Carlos says. Come on says the leader beckoning to them, and they began to run down the mountain after the creature, the storm on the horizon drawing closer to them. ----------------------------------------------------------- The storm is getting closer, yells Mercedes staring up at the sky in front of the farmhouse. Help me get the animals into shelter. Yes Ms. Hernando says Mercedes running to help herd the sheep, chickens, and cattle into the barn shelter and then placing wooden crates and plywood sheets around it.

Later that evening, Drax walks out of the hotel smiling and dressed in a colourful tropical shirt with trees and skies, a mountain top, and he walks about this new town, below the yellow sun and dark blue sky, a warm summer breeze and white clouds streaked across the endless sky.

Drax says there are tons of great deals we should be able to get with the little bit of money we could obtain in this time stream. Just what I always wanted to do, go on a spendthrift shopping spree. replies Tina. What do you suppose the boys are doing? she inquired. Drax is negotiating for supplies we might need to scale those mountains in the far distance. replies Mercedes. Mountains, what mountains are you talking about?

It is a long trip to the mountains. Drax says, as they noticed a large crowd of people starting to come to see what's what as the dust settled in after the battle with the Culto warriors. Whats in the mountains? Asks James, as they all rise to their feet. One of the locals here told me a legend about great magical powers like instant transportation being observed in the mountains by some who return alive, barely making it out of there with their lives.

The mountains approaching were ominous and fearsome like goliaths overseeing all and the falling rocks and terrifying smoke above their peaks were continuous warnings to those who dare transgress their corridors.

All five led by Drax squeeze together on the machine, and take off towards the mountain range nearby leaving the two beasts locked in mortal combat snarling at one another.

Drax led the team on the hovering motorcycle barely touching the ground because of the extra weight as they approached a mountain quarry. Were not going to make it, screams Tina its too heavy. Where theres a will theres a way! Exclaims Drax as he pressed a few buttons on the motorcycle and held the handle bars tightly, We can jettison the fuel and accelerate for a quick boost up the mountainside using the stone as leverage for the bikes hover coils I think, but if we miss our mark we will fall to our deaths. Lets hope the timing is right! says Tina. Hmm, muttered Drax.

As they approached the summit several miles into the air, they came close to a ledge on the mountainside near a cave and stopped in mid hover right below the ledge. Engine is being pushed to the limit and burning out, we cant scale the cliff! Drax screams, Brace for impact! Not yet. says James, as he waved his right hand down underneath the bike as it started to fall and it then lifted upward slowly towards the ledge and levelled out on the precipice. Close one, says Mercedes. Bikes dead, says Drax as he dismounted with his group and pulled out his handheld scanner. There appears to be a large energy signature nearby.

The power it is rumoured to have has got to be worth billions. She smirks as the flight continues uninterrupted and the mountains were in the distance. We should get off near there, she pointed.

Hovering above the intrepid calamity of the dark forest is the scorpion car with Drax and his dumbfounded cohorts. There it is, says Drax pointing up towards the precipice of the cavern in the mountain terrain rapidly approaching before them. We have to get up there to the cavern of lights, he says as the blue and red lights twinkling in the cavern before them as they approached got closer and closer.

How did we survive that quicksand? Maybe we have a guardian angel says Tina. Humph we should get moving. Drax says. Where? asks James, there is no way to go, but back way down the cliff in your hooped-up hyper-maintained up scorpion mobile. This riddle may hold the answer, says Drax, two sides at odds meaning conflict ancient meaning possible eternal history and destiny  change to something otherworldly, meaning perhaps a symbol of some godly regimen. Eternal conflict, good vs. evil, darkness vs. light started Mercedes. A ying yang! yells Tina excitedly.

They walk for miles until reaching the base of the mountain at the far side of the great island.

Drax led the way with his wrist devices light beacon. Spooky says Tina. Yeah, but I am not afraid says James, I will protect you. My hero says Tina. We need to get up there says Mercedes looking up at the caves to either side of them, built into the mountain walls at the end of the island passing, but with no precipice just openings in the rock face. I know just the thing says Drax. Yes. Mercedes responds knowing what he is referring to. Am I going to see the Scorpion car now? asks Tina jokingly. Indeed Drax says fiddling with his wrist device and pressing the right keys.

With that and Tina expressing a shock of joy and bewilderment, the five adventurers squeezed into the scorpion car and flew upward levitating against the wind currents into the inlets of the mountain range.

The weapon blasted a hole in the side of the mountain in a terrific explosion.

The eight marched onward on horseback for miles during the intense heat of the daylight sun and they stop to rest once before continuing and making their way to the caverns hovering above the terrain in mountains that were raised upward by the shifting land masses. Look, says James dismounting his horse, herbs just like in my vision. he reached for some and then kept walking and climbing upward into the cave. Wait here and keep an eye on the horses men, says Celia to the guards as she followed James and Mercedes into the cavern, crawling at first then raising up once settled into the narrow dark paths. I wish that we were less likely to travel in dark tunnels says James. Take what you can get says Mercedes.

They rolled down the hill until they came to a grassy precipice overlooking a cliff to the valley below with a series of small platforms in the rock face.

A small tree stripped of most of its leaves has branched out over the cliff.

Drax felt himself head face down over the cliff as Tina let go of the time stone in her attempt to hold on to the tree, causing it to tumble down the hill and over the cliff moving past Drax as he felt himself pulled upward as Mercedes  grabbed his leg with her free arm.

The quartet continues forward along the grassy hill country to the mountains in the distance seeing a glimpse of light at the summit.

Sally and he had only lived here in the mountains for a little over two years.

When her eyes were staring at the jewels in self-pity, he dug for jewelry in the small mountains of treasures that he knew would, aside from the coveted late countesss collar, be to her likening and suit her beauty.

I like to pick my way through a trail of rocks and roots a moving body in the still earth wild wind companion creek sun blaze tree shade lazy magpie foraging squirrel white noise of waterfall descending lichen-blanketed granite beside wildflower bounty and scent of dust and dry pine in the air til afternoon rain releases dampening life and my soul long buried in paved tombs exhumed enlivened and feet find their way

Snow crystals become water drops and, given time, carve cleavage into mountain bosoms to nurse life and wanderings.

When the road curves or the cliff climbs, and the way is blocked, then the only way forward is back.

The mountains are outside of time and going nowhere, filling everywhere with what was and is and is to come.

Peaks tease us toward heights which halve our reason; we are passengers in time, lasting only a blink of Gods eye, too loose and shifting to last, while the pack and density of mountains adhere them to eternity.

Do you stand balanced between mountains or are you wrapped inside a cloud or do you drink the river whole as you swim like a salmon to completion this is the natural order

There is not a power in me that mirrors the might of a mountain or the intensity of the ocean.

No lava can congeal To form a craggy mountain or a formidable rock enough to rival my unyielding, awesome writers block.

Emily Bauer, a born and raised Iowan, heard the call of the mountains and decided to answer.

Kyoto Gardens was the stop for the day, and shortly before we arrived she informed me of how we were to see a waterfall and giant goldfish.

Shed sent me pictures of the waterfall earlier in the summer, but still I was wary of any giant goldfish. Youre sure theyre goldfish, right? I repeated several times as we walked to the platform at East Ham. Like, theyre not a different kind of fish? I mean, thats what they look to me.

The challenge stage Climbing up the mountain to retrieve your treasure.

The journey up the mountain is challenging, but rewarding in many ways too.

At the top of the mountain we have been climbing all this time, we find the treasure we have been seeking.

They will show you the beauty of a cascading mountain stream with a backdrop of jagged peaks above scraggly pines at the tree line just below the sun's slanting rays.

There are those whose mind is like a mountain ringed with clouds: whose thoughts are noble and wise; who have the spirit of an eagle; who remain graceful and free in the face of adversity

Though the way the building sat precariously on the edge of the cliff sickened her, Melanie felt obsessed with locating the property.

To think that anything besides maybe a bear or a mountain lion could have mauled Carl like that would have been unthinkable twenty-four hours ago. Did she have blonde hair? Lucas bit his lip. How did she look? I dont know.

To her surprise, she had been dreaming about a castle high atop a craggy cliff, with the ocean crashing below.

Just as she was about to give up, the woods suddenly parted, revealing a massive structure balanced precariously on a cliff ledge over the proposed rail line.

It is like the dew of Hermon coming down upon the mountains of Zion; for there the LORD commanded the blessinglife forever.

The mountains here get a lot of snow in the winter and spring.

Do you think you can convince your father to take you up to the mountains for a little camping trip?

I heard just meditating in the mountains can be a little cathartic especially when you need to heal from something as devastating as this. Lone Wolfe shrugged, I guess I can try.

It will hit a mountain and break apart and that is assuming it has enough space and time to form in the first place.

What brought you to me? A week ago, our clairvoyant advisor told us that he sensed a massive disturbance in the mountains northeast of here.

It reminded them of how the mountains would feel.

It still got cold, close to freezing up in the mountains this time of year.

So when Shawn walked in two hours before closing wearing scuba goggles over his beanie with a snorkel and a flashlight, he braced himself for the topple down the mountain of good vibes hed spent the evening conquering.

Onell set you straight. Almost disappointed but slightly relieved, he said, Aight, Mig. He pronounced Miguels abbreviated handle like it was short for midget  an irony the little guy reveled in. Good lookin. A handful of tap water drowned the pill into oblivion. You gon roll too? Miguel pulled the pill apart and dumped the powder on the back of his hand. I prefer to take mine to the head. With a voracious snort, the little powder-mountain disappeared in a whiff. How longs it take to hit? For you?

Prolly means the air wouldnt be so thick, so wed be gettin higher off less weed cuz thered be less oxygen, like what they say about smokin up in the mountains an shit. Freal? He passed the thinking torch back to the budding philosopher in their midst. Uh-huh Puff, puff At least, I think so Exhale Shit makes sense to me. If you say so, nigga An them plants would be like the size of houses  less gs to weigh em down. Damn Thas a trip, though Astronomy was more of Marvins thing, but Shawn was just as much a dreamer in his own right. What about on Venus, bruh? Pshhh That place a wasteland, nigga.

Maybe they was gon put a rest stop here or somethin  picnic tables an shit. Aight, well wheres this big-ass cliff you pissed offa? Watch This shit crazy. They started on their way, walking perpendicular to the path, not making it very far before realizing they shouldve brought flashlights. Damn Cant see shit Marvin used his phones flash to illuminate their course.

Marvin realized he would have likely fallen off the cliff and into a soaring, one-hundred-foot plummet if hed been out there walking around in the dark without his guide.

They agreed they could get the truck nearly through to the cliff if they chained the tires and avoided a few trees.

Considering ol George was the heftiest sack of the three, around half way to the cliff they seemed to catch a break, sliding along more easily than the previous timesuntil the load seemed a little too light for Marvin to accept as smooth sailing. Hold up What? He looked up, then walked around the backside of their haul. Aww, hell nah! Shawn wasnt ready for another hitch in their plans.

Apparently, they had all seen how Azu had tackled the doe to the floor. Like a mountain lion, Andrew said, and to Koles shock, everyone agreed.

Stay with me. Zanders reassuring voice sounded as though he was yelling to me from some distant mountain top.

So, I let it fester on my mountain of hatred, and I bided my time.

Likes throwing himself down mountains n out of planes n stuff. Well, Will twinkles like the Christmas tree, all sly suggestion and not-so-subtle hints. Why dont you learn?

Then, once hes confident, he can invite Greg out onto the slopes and they can have their moment against the backdrop of mountains robed in snow and scattered with pine trees.

In reality, he lasts approximately eleven and a half minutes of Finns patronising repetition of relax your knees, your knees, Patrick, relax them, no, thats the opposite of relax, just relax before his fuse  admittedly already short  runs out and the end of his rope is officially reached. Snowboarding is ridiculous, Patrick announces loudly, struggling to kick his feet free from the stupid board. This outfit is ridiculous, this mountain is ridiculous, fastening my feet to sixty-four inches of fibreglass is ridiculous and you, he points squarely at Finn who pushes up his goggles and widens his eyes  copper bright, twinkle sharp and framed by thick, dark lashes  innocently, You are fucking ridiculous. So Not enjoying it? Finn asks mildly, catching Patrick and steadying him against his chest - solid, even through the jacket and Patrick is getting goosebump shivers - as he wobbles on his bound feet. Click em to the left, dude.

Anyway, he pays people to do things he cant do himself and, seriously, he cant be his own boyfriend and he doesnt have a whole lot of options halfway up a mountain in Colorado. Seriously.

Theyre sickening, ordering champagne to celebrate their first Christmas together  first of many, Trickserbelle  a dark head tucked under blonde hair as Greg looks thoughtful. I hope you dont mind that we took the master suite, Patrick slurs, drunk on golden bubbles that tickle his nose. `Sjust First vacation s special, right? Yeah, Drew mutters sullenly into his Sprite and fruit salad - veganism is a bitch - bitter brown glare focused all on Patrick. Were fine in a twin bed. Youre too kind, Drew, Finn declares, already on his feet and pulling Patrick with him. Youre a treasure, a gem, a total babe Finn carries on singing endearments as they shrug into their coats  Finns is still lime green, still awful, Patricks is still expensive and understated and purchased from a boutique in Beverly Hills and no way suited to the mountains of Colorado in December  and crunch their way along the path.

He climbs the stairs like it hurts, like hes aged fifty years, like each step is a mountain but not the one he remembers from a ski lift and a gloved hand against a bench seat begging to be grasped.

Maybe No, not even a little Rude, Patrick thinks, But that kid is telling his dad about you, Finn points to the furious looking mountain of a man with the tattletale asshole of a kid pointing directly at them. And he looks fucking terrifying so Big slopes it is. That sounds like an excellent idea to Patrick who finds a speed his legs didnt know they were capable of as they power along to the ski lift.

Love Patrick Finn doesnt pause to think as he roots around on the floor for his clothes, doesnt worry that his jeans and leather jacket are woefully inadequate for chasing someone across a ski resort halfway up a mountain but it doesnt matter.

Finn wants to object but fuck its so warm and it smells delightfully like Patrick so he goes with it, tilts his head to brush another kiss to the plush softness of Patricks Chapstick-slicked lips. Finn, Patrick points out gently. Im leaving tomorrow Could we, like, talk about this someplace else? Finn begs, cold water leaking through his socks. Someplace warm, maybe? I swear to God, Finn, Patrick rolls his eyes but grabs his board like a pro, huffing out faked irritation as Finn nuzzles into his neck with a grateful sigh. Who comes charging up the side of a goddamn mountain in Converse? A fool in love! Finn declares dramatically, falling silent under the sharp glare he receives in response.

Reese nudges him again and sends another waterfall of chilled pale ale down the back of his jeans.

He had the works: fountains, a big pool and even a fucking waterfall in his living room.

(I mean, come on, you have a remote orphanage out there in the middle of nowhere, with armed scavengers coming out in droves and giant dumpster ships dropping trash to form huge mountains all over the place.

I left Denver and started driving into the mountains toward Aspen.

Out of the side of a mountain I saw huge clouds, giant waves of water and massive amounts of water from rain.

The airport was made of glass and was cut into the side of a mountain directly west of me.

I was close to the Old City of David and it was during the day, and I saw the mountains surrounding Jerusalem.

Again you shall take up your tambourines, and go forth in the dances of those who rejoice. 5 Again you shall plant vines on the mountains of Shomeron.

For  has created what is new on Earth: a woman encompasses a man! 23 Thus said  of hosts, the Elohim of Yisral, Let them once again say this word in the land of Yehudah and in its cities, when I turn back their captivity,  bless you, O home of righteousness, mountain of set-apartness! 24 And in Yehudah and all its cities farmers and those who journey with flocks, shall dwell together. 25 For I shall fill the weary being, and I shall replenish every grieved being. 26 At this I awoke and looked around, and my sleep was sweet to me. 27 See, the days are coming, declares , that I shall sow the house of Yisral and the house of Yehudah with the seed of man and the seed of beast. 28 And it shall be, that as I have watched over them to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict, so I shall watch over them to build and to plant, declares . 29 In those days they shall no longer say, The fathers ate sour grapes, and the childrens teeth are blunted. 30 But each one shall die for his own crookedness  whoever eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be blunted. 31 See, the days are coming, declares , when I shall make a renewed covenant with the house of Yisral and with the house of Yehudah, 32 not like the covenant I made with their fathers in the day when I strengthened their hand to bring them out of the land of Mitsrayim, My covenant which they broke, though I was a husband to them, declares . 33 For this is the covenant I shall make with the house of Yisral after those days, declares : I shall put My Torah in their inward parts, and write it on their hearts.

Given the number of houses and lack of major amenities, Betts figures the population might be around two or three hundred people  if that. Where should we stop? Art asks. The beach, she says. I want to stretch my legs. They find a carpark on a cliff overlooking the coast.

The cliff is high and uneven, and has no railing to prevent wayward tourists from falling to their deaths.

He reaches the cliff steps and jogs down them to the beach, turning in the opposite direction from the place they found the glass.

Just beyond them is a cliff and a sharp drop to the water.

A trickling waterfall flows down the steps toward the main stage.

He ventured past two mountains that mirrored in opposing directions.

He ignored the Bytopic mountain and the grand abyss.

Even mountains and entire land masses.

It may interest you to know that before making all these consultations, I decided to go with the popular saying by the polymath, Francis Bacon in Essays (1625) that, "If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain".

A small mountain of dishes had piled up by the sink, and he could hear the heavy clanks of the waitress setting down more.

The mountains shone in the distance like piles of gold covered in moss.

It bounced off the mountain of trash inside, tumbling into a square of sunlight beneath the window.

Several seconds of propaganda passedthe Republics banners and flags waving triumphantly in the wind; a simple farmer tilting his smiling, sunlit face to the sky; a young Harold Targin Kole standing heroically at the edge of a cliff, surveying the lands he had conquered, his body tall and lean, his face the bookish visage of an ambitious student.

She managed to smuggle you out of a military research facility in the mountains northwest of here, but she had to sacrifice herself to do it.

I could run the car over a cliff, somewhere it will take a while to be discovered."

There was a sharp turn at the bottom of a steep slope where a cliff dropped dangerously away into thick undergrowth and fir.

Corbin aimed for a gap between two of the moving mountains and was swallowed a second later by their cover. Everyone get ready for a bumpy ride. He radioed to his team. Copy, replied Diver zero-two-seven. Got it, Kora responded. Just how I like it! Laz laughed into the com.

It formed a large breach where a canyon of vapor formed around the up swell in deep cliff walls.

He deactivated his radar imaging, returning to the raw, visible light spectrum, to view the immense cliff walls of vapor that towered above him as they shifted against the high pressure canyon of helium.

The light was having to penetrate farther and farther through the multiple cloud levels, but, occasionally, the cover would part and allow more light to penetrate and reveal the internal vistas of the bubbling mountain ranges and valleys in between.

The Raik swayed its mountain sized head more rapidly than usual, but still seemed to mostly ignore the sensation.

The carbon crusted ridge appearing like the dark rocky crest of a mountain peak in sharp contrast to the silver and gold-sheen of the skin.

She turned her head to look over her shoulder to view the Raik behind her, the mountain of crested beak shifting from side to side with a slow swimming motion.

He tasted all at once its many constituent parts, gravity flowed around and through him like a waterfall toward the center of the planet, he could see the magnetic and electrical field twisting and jumping from the present Raiks.

Shes climbed mountains (small ones!) and taken long hikes, plus had extensive photography lessons with Jess from Leave Nothing But Footprints.

He took in a deep breath, hoping for inspiration, hoping that a mountain breeze would fill his lungs and his soul and provide him with whatever was needed at the moment.

Full sun, a creek flowing under a bridge like any other mountain stream, maybe a bit more vigorously, sure, but the very same creek hed seen in other years when he hiked the trails that followed it to its source, the very same creek from which he fetched his drinking water.

There was a powerful wind that tore the mountains apart.

I have peered down through clouds on mountain peaks, and dived from boats in crystal clear oceans, landed places a great sojourner seeks, and drank my fill of intense emotions.

Poisoner via above drops rope onto clone and gestures him to get onto it which he obeys climbing the cliff wall and rope to above.

Blood red lines led to deep purple brushstrokes depicting mountains and valleys.

South of the village along the coast the map was covered in large trianglesa mountain rang.

Have you ever seen a wall of flame? Lian simply shrugged. Even if it is true, maybe we can go around by the coast. Come on, Corlu, you know that the cliffs become impassable.  Lian jabbed his finger at the mountains and blue symbols indicating whirlpools.  Theres no way to get around that direction.

If an exploration party followed the coastline for as far they could go, they could avoid most of the mountain range and then they could at least get a sense of what the Remains really were.

Moving to the mountains would either mean the villages death or a transformation into something completely new.

They would be thrown up against the cliff face and torn to pieces.

On the second day, they noticed that the beach was narrowing and the cliff face growing taller.

When they passed an opening caused by a small mountain stream, they stopped to make a decision.

It had become clearer and clearer with every slight bend in the coastline that the only way up was the break in the cliff they had stopped at this morning.

Apologizing, however, was going to be relatively easy compared to the daunting task of making herself climb up that cliff.

Now she was going to have to climb straight up a cliff face, and the back of her neck went clammy just thinking about it.

The waves were already washing up to the feet of the cliff, and they had little time to sit and think about the climb.

The cliff loomed menacingly above her and presented a face of almost seamless granite.

He was slightly above them now and obscured by the bulge in the cliff. Its not so bad, he called back.

Suddenly, Corlu knew that she had to move now, had to go before the paralysis meant she was left whimpering on the cliff face for all eternity.  Deera, she gasped.  Ill go next. Deera nodded and made way for her.

She was mid-air; she was going to plummet off the ledge, down the cliff to the boulders below.

Turning away from the cliff, she let her body shake out all the fear and strain of the climb.

The sun burned her face in constant interplay with the cold mountain air that gusted up from the sea below.

They stood at the cliff edge, looking south. So, what can you see? she called. Mountains, mountains, and more mountains, Deera answered. The cliffs seem to go on forever.

Ever since the cliff climb, she had been filled with a sense of confidence about their expedition.

To the left far in the distance lay a chain of grim mountains and a haze of black smoke.

Sure enough, against the age-dulled texture of old paint sparkled the tiniest speck of shimmering purple, a scrap of paint that had somehow survived the roll of years and one that matched the color of the mountains on their lost map.

To her right, far off in the distance the tallest mountain smoked, and in a line from the mountain ran a swathe of black rock, a giants path.

All was caught up in the light from the nearly full moon, black rock, silver grey sand, like a dark river stone inset in the frost. My aunt spoke of mountains that suddenly spewed hot fire and black rivers of fiery rock. Corlu turned back to Deera.  You think that rock came from the mountain? Yes and I think it destroyed the people who lived here.

Against her will, her mind filled with images, painful in their poignancy:  Deera laughing at one of Lians stupid jokes, Deera holding out a hand as she helped Corlu up the cliff face, her brown eyes soft and kind, Deera lying quietly in the firelight, listening to the others speak.

The ground ran downwards to the water, but ended abruptly in a crumbling cliff.

It was placed expertly at Corlu's throat.  Move, or die. Go ahead, yelled Corlu, furious.  Id rather you stabbed me than be pushed over a cliff.  She laughed hysterically.  What a choice. Strangely, the girl herself began to laugh, emitting loud choking hoots and snorts.  Were not going to push you over.

If anything could have matched the horror of the cliff climb up from the sea caves, it was the descent down the flimsy rope ladder.

Its just I cant believe its lasted more than a--- Enough talking, shouted one of the boys.  Move! Corlu was wondering how long her sweaty, grazed fingers were going to last when surprisingly the rock face she had been staring at suddenly curved away backwards underneath the cliff in a small cave.

She twisted her head back and forth, excitedly taking it all in and already imagining how she would describe the scene to Anathe rich green and brown wetlands, the forest and waterfall behind, the wild blue ocean breaking on the sands. Stop, ordered Eli, as they came to the edge of the greenish brown waters.

They were wearing cloth from the villages. Where? demanded Leela. In the mountains before the desert.  Lian explained.  Two adults and a child.

She scaled the cliff face nine times that day, the last time in the dark, long after sunset.

The next day, however, when, with aching muscles, she had been sent up the cliff, Corlu found that her panic and fear had abated to a mild nervousness.

She didnt know if she was quite ready to start scaling cliff faces, but the climb up to the canyon opening held no more fear for her.

A noise to her left told her that Shiall had returned from patrolling the waterfall area.

Youve been up by the waterfall all day, and we just got back.

It was their job to watch the island, while those who were older and stronger ranged in the canyons and glades above the cliff or along the coastline. This is the last warning.

What do you want me to do? Gaz looked up the cliff for anything to tie his rope onto.

Stepping to the end of the wooden platform, he jumped off and landed on the grass covered cliff.

He was starting to panic as the reality of his decision was starting to set in. Frozen with fear, he hung onto the cliff with his eyes shut.

Climbing up past the roof, Gaz tied the end of the rope to a rock sticking out of the cliff.

Placing his hands on the rope, he slowly worked them out from the cliff.

Where exactly is that artifact! In an abandoned home, hanging on the eastern cliff of the city. Chasens words were forced as he struggled to regain control of his own mind. Dont do this.

I want all three of them to be watched all night with triple staffing. He then stomped away to help destroy the home hanging on the cliff before the Alchemist found what he was looking for.

(Surat al-A'raf: 142) Leaving his people behind, the Prophet Moses (pbuh) reached the mountain of Horeb within the appointed time.

The Wandering Stars The major reason why many Bible students believe that the planet will be hit by an asteroid and a comet in the end times is because of the book of Revelation, chapter 8 And the second angel sounded [his] trumpet, and [something] like a great burning mountain was thrown into the sea, and the third of the sea became blood.

So anyway, John sees the first as a great burning mountain and the second as a great starburning like a torch. The first one appears to be mostly terrestrial in composition, and so would be more reminiscent of an asteroid, while the second has several hallmarks of a comet (well discuss those hallmarks in a minute).

Typically speaking, a mountain is an elevation of at least 1,000 feet (Mount Moriah, the Temple Mount, is about 2,500 feet above sea level).

If the burning mountain and burning torch had already fallen by the time we get to Revelation 8, I think John would have used perfective verbals, just as he did in 9:1 to describe the star with the key.

And the sky was split [fig., receded] like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island were moved out of their places.

And they say to the mountains and to the rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from [the] face of the One sitting on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb!

-- Matthew 24:14 Mount Moriah will fall, and the burning mountain from the Almighty will be cast into the sea.

"Supposedly there's this cave behind a waterfall with a whole mess of gold."

she asked, bringing up the waterfall on her maps.

Og hurled another stone at the cliff face.

It struck the cliff face and splintered.

Got a mountain of paperwork for all this."

The trees were beginning to leaf out, but were still immature enough that she could see the mountains and canyons peeking through from her downtown Avenues home...

The snow-covered mountain tops loomed like icing atop the rooflines of the gabled historic homes in the immediate line of vision.

Don was a successful dentist, now retired and living with his wife in luxury in the high mountains of Peru.

On the inside lid of the casket was a silk-screened nature scene of trees with rugged mountains in the background.

We like all of these features, but wed like to swap out the mountains and trees for the temple.

She gazed across the Valley to the distant mountains to the west. Of course.

She swallowed hard and started reading. The first giants lived in the high m-maa  Mountains, the lord supplied, leaning so close she felt the heat of his body. mountains long before the first men.

She also cant believe that hes grown into such a broad-shouldered, mountain of a man, or that he has no compunction about baring her bottom for a sound spanking when she gives him trouble, even on their wedding day.

They cannot remain on the mountain forever though, and he must get her to conceive a child before they may enter the immortal world of Stellia once again.

Her need to know if this emptiness is really love leads her to Afghanistan during the British withdrawal, and to a mountain battlefield, and possibly to at last finding out whether you can love someone you dont know.

The mountains are really all I miss.

Echo could feel panic rising inside her body, constricting her chest and clouding her thoughts. Narcissus... A nightmarish vision of a life without her soul mate filled her head; wandering the world alone, loneliness her constant companion; watching with envious eyes as a man and a woman walked past her holding hands; standing on the edge of a cliff staring into the distance, her face devoid of emotion, happiness a distant memory; falling to her knees on the edge of a river bank screaming Narcissuss name. No!  shouted Echo, shaking her head.

These mountain men!

A whole mountain of neurosharing girls, and I stand at the top, awake.

In the center, a white, almost-fungal mountain of heaped flesh.

The ability to control life and death in the animal kingdom was a limited extension of Artemis own abilities and with it came a set of rules which ensured the propagation of the animal kingdom by restricting where and when animals could be hunted, and the protection of its environment by designating as sacred: groves, sanctuaries, rivers, mountain tops.

Sandy
She turned around to notice the pretty green grass and flowers fizzle out and turn to yellow sand, almost like a fire ate it alive.

Were going to some beach resort tomorrow for a couple of days.

The next day, the three women went to a beach resort for a couple of days.

Would you like to go to the beach for two weeks on our honeymoon?

Then Ill reserve the beach house.

You call this a beach house? asked Cassie, as she and Brianna entered just before sunset.  Id like to see what you call a mansion.

The beach house, owned by the Royal Family of Thorr, was a two-story mansion on a private beach.

After breakfast, Brianna and Cassie headed out of the beach house dressed in jeans, t-shirts, and boots.

Brianna strapped the picnic basket to her horses saddle and said, Well ride down the beach this way, she pointed, as she mounted her horse.  Then well take the trail up into mountains to the river.

Its housed two miles down the beach near the slip.

If you have a yacht, why dont you just park it out front of the beach house?

Brianna and Cassie spent the rest of their honeymoon at the beach house, enjoying the sunshine and the ocean  and most of all each other.

Cassie said to Brianna, Lets turn around and go back to the beach house.

The beach house is a Julia-free zone, Cassie whispered in her ear, and began kissing her neck.

But can we go to the beach for vacations and for anniversaries?

As soon as you get a break in your concert schedule, they would like for the four of us to get together for a weekend  either at the palace or at the beach house.

Oh, the beach house would be great.

It means that we can use your vacation days to go hang out at the beach house  instead of using them up on our concert tours.  Cassie turned to Suzie and Vanita, You guys hurry up and get pregnant.

Were going to the beach house.

Later that day at the beach house...

Cassie sat on the beach alone, watching the sunset as the tide rolled in.

Brianna pushed Cassie down on the beach and started another round of passionate kisses, until another wave engulfed them.

When they got back to the beach house, Cassie opened a bottle of red wine, grabbed a couple of glasses and towels, and joined Brianna out on the deck.

* * * I really appreciate you guys making time to come visit, Cassie said to Anton, back inside the beach house.  I think visiting with Adrianna is just what Brianna needs right now.

Later that evening, Brianna and Cassie and Adrianna and Anton were served dinner on the deck of the beach house.

Whenever Brianna and Cassie werent relaxing on the beach or on the deck, Brianna was pursuing one of her favorite pastimes: cooking.

They landed on the beach of the planet around sunrise.

This is a beach - like where I grew up near Galveston.

Stoutmire was sitting underneath an umbrella on the deck of the beach house, reading a good book.

Finally, they retired for the night aboard the yacht, as the captain and crew sailed back to the beach house.

The next morning, the yacht was docked in front of the beach house.

Then the children played on the beach until it was time to return to Star Base.

Im looking forward to our second honeymoon at the beach (I still have that servants uniform).

Two weeks later and a few hours before my first race we arrived at Brighton Beach as the tide departed leaving large areas of firm sand.

Excitedly we took the sidecar off the trailer and pushed her to the sand.

I lay stunned and winded on the sand, dazed and confused.

He wouldve maintained his silence all the way through the school doors with Goodson and into the cafeteria for their free breakfast if not for the sudden need to yell, Goodson! as he watched his dance captain tremble and shake  not from dancing  but from the crippling onset of system shock, Goodsons body paying its nutritional debt with pain. 2 Marshmallow pies of cake encrusted banana whipped Tot and Tater, the twin Jetpax members who were synched even when it wasnt Sync Day, whipped Tot and Tater into such a state of sugar withdrawal that they were nothing but four hypervigilant eyes, four gigantic hungry eyes, eyes the size of beach balls craving those gooey yellow discs. Goodness gracious, Tot whistled to her brother, Tater, studying the sweet, sweet treats that their rival dance crew, The Boppers, were munching, enjoying, savoring. I mean, gooooooooodness, she intoned in her deep southern accent. Tater.

So, I buried my head in the sand all the deeper.

Its Alicia--! Golich looked up.  Toonieyoure crackedAlicias but he stopped in mid-sentence, for they had both seen the hypersuited figure waddle unsteadily through the surf, stumble onto the beach and drop to its knees.

They helped the Defense and Protective Systems tech to her feet, brushed wet sand off her face and shouldered her up the slope to the ship, where she ducked through the lockout on F deck and ran straight into Captain Dringoth. Well, wellJumpmaster Yangdecided to pay us a visit, did you?  Dringoth queried Acth:One and Golich.  She okayshe hurtwhats her condition? But before Golich could respond, Yang blurted out, CaptainCaptainyouve got to come with mecome down to the beach.

K-World was the fourth world out, a smallish, desert world with huge seas of copper-colored sand and one large notable body of water, a vast shallow lake known as Loch Lithgow.

The cavern was black as night on that heading, and footing was treacherous with ice and loose sand or gravel.

Report by Yekaterina: The beach is the best place for meditation in my case.

on sand of same complexion.

Selby promised Khloe a beach afternoon, and they headed out.

The tier itself looked like water and sand.

The woman has never made it a secret that she likes the way I look, so when I decided to go for a beach run.

I sit in a desk chair and wipe the sweat and sand off my face.

The grit of the sand mixed with sweat gripped your skin like another layer, and I immediately longed for a shower.

I make it in and take a long shower, and I put on one of Aces sand tees I stole before he left, and then, I pass out cold.

Cant go taking your camera on the beach blanket with you, he joked.

Barton shook his head but played along: Some morning from the boulder-broken beach He would cry out on life, that what it wants Is not its own love back in copy speech, But counter-love, original response. And Zach said: And nothing ever came of what he cried. He stopped there, less than halfway through the poem.

Cant you at least let me try? She took her beach towel and spread it on the bottom of the boat at her feet. Sit here please. She pointed at the towel.

With his head pillowed on his folded arm atop the blanket on the sand of the beach, Zach secretly studied Donnas face and upper body in profile, her eyes closed (was she asleep?) against the hot August sun.

Donna learned about this secluded beach from some distant relative that owned a weekend trailer nearby; and she knew where the key to that trailer was hid, in case they needed to use the toilet or otherwise avail themselves of indoor shelter.

But so far theyd spent the whole afternoon outside, either lying out on the narrow strip of sand beyond the lofty pines with their soft bed of needles, or swimming in the murky and warm water with its slimy bottom and mix of submerged hazards (tree stumps, decaying vines, maybe even some old fence posts and rusting wire).

The side facing east shows some sun-damage, and a swath of the side facing north shows some bad discoloration left over from the last time she needed to be sand-blasted for graffiti.

Apodids, distant descendants of Earths swiftlets, combed the beach below for the shimmering blue and green bivalves that were abundant in the costal regions.

Pirate ships were moored off the white sand beaches, their guns silent but ominous.

We walked over the sodden sand into the weeds.

Its true, I hated Clearview: The beach was okay, but at night there was nothing to do but drink.

I mean who craves fish head, chicken bones and agidi?11 Who craves the smell of sand and cries because she hasnt eaten ice cubes?

The compound was a sparse set up of sand and trees littered around.

Nkechi and her friends were seated butt naked in the sand, building castles with the sand.

Why this woman wan come pour sand, sand for my garri na?74

Suddenly, the sand disappears under her feet.

She struggles to get away from him, but he pulls her ashore, drags her on to a sand bank and pushes her down, until she's flat on her back.

There was a park with a slide and swing set, a sand box and teeter-totters.

His hand was lightly calloused, as she thought it might be from years of construction-type work, but his grip was strong, and Melody could imagine what it might be like to walk along hand in hand with him at the beach or along a moonlit path.

Why do you think Im wearing this awful thing? he asked, yanking on the oversized shirt that had an image of a dog laying in a lounge chair on a beach with a tropical drink in his hand. But I cant go anywhere looking like this. I have an idea.

It turned out that the new omega, Hank, had become ordained a few years ago in order to marry some friends on a beach in Hawaii, and he volunteered to perform the ceremony.

On that occasion the risen Christ asked for food and ate fish in front of them all, and a short time later He cooked them breakfast on the beach by the Sea of Galilee (John 21:12).

He glanced back at their lead car wallowing in a sand section of the road.

They were like hewn wood after all the beating against sand filled leather and even against the hard Ash trees in the masters back lot.

This confrontation does not take place on a distant beach on Asia, or in the trenches of the European fields, it is located on the mind, because the human brain is the most important resource on the planet Earth, not water, not oil, the mind!

Harold, he told me the next morning, had actually spent the night on a beach in Guatemala.

Between her husband and her pets, she is never lonely, and should she ever disappear one might look for her on a beach in Tahiti, sipping a tropical drink and wearing a disguise.

A small dune of white sand had crested the hill like a snowdrift.

A freshening wind which swept our robes and clothing and would soon spread a rippled pattern over the spot I had raked in the sand.

I dont think anything you can say will make me think you deserve what you are going through. Don replied. You might change your mind on that.  Amanda continued.  My boyfriend Randy and I had gone to the beach for the afternoon and had a few drinks while we were out.

Carpe Diem-Is a series of books about a handy man who house sits at a beach house for a rich snowbird.

He smiles and nods. Or maybe hopping in the jet for a weekend in Paris or lying on the beach in Hawaii.

When he wasn't wearing a business suit, Eric looked like your typical California beach bum.

We ran into the home and extinguished the fire in the grate using a bucket of sand.

Again, we ran into the home and extinguished the fire in the grate using a bucket of sand.

However, as we ran into the home and extinguished the fire in the grate using a bucket of sand, we heard a loud squealing noise coming from the chimney.

The handful of headbanger burnouts, mostly kids whose broken family lives had dragged them from Columbia or Augusta into the sand hill wastes of Bablyon Springs, snickered and rolled their eyes and made plans to meet behind the football bleachers to smoke whatever it was they smoked back there.

We can also teach you, should you desire, how to bathe with dust and sand and ashes.

Now here they stand, in accusation of their Creator. The Holy Culvert flows not with water, but with the accursed desert sand.

I pick off the slimy little pieces of avocado and toss them in the sand on my way back to the truck.

In the mirror, I see this weird old tattooed California poof, and I watch as he sinks to his knees in the sand.

You ain't never gonna guess what I saw on the beach earlier, Mama. What's that. There was a man, with spiders tattooed all over his body.

It was odd to find myself on the beach with them, as though it had not been planned.

Yesterday, I went to the beach and worked out at Raabs. Hows your love life? I am still lonely.

Its technically, autumn, already. Im not much of a beach person.

The others in the family are fine, financially, and we live in a great neighborhood. But Steve, youre not much into the teen culture of beach parties and stuff, from what Ive seen of you when you go to Long Beach. I would be serious about my situation, without even thinking about it. Actually, I feel that you would be using your talents to their best by staying in New York. You know, I was just floatin the idea out there, only.

I also get the feeling of time like they say on The Days of Our Lives about time like sand through the hour glass.

A woman sat on a bench at the park watching two small children who played happily in the sand beneath a slide.

I searched the scents, allowing my brain to categorize them as they did when I was in wolf form. I smell sand baked by the sun until it smells of cinnamon and dried leather, of pages so old the trees they came from are forgotten from memory, and of an animal. I tipped my head without opening my eyes. Is that a camel?

And if its setting in the silt, sand or mud, its probably going to be a non-wobbler, regardless of shape. That actually does make some sense. Well, youre going to have to choose a theory; you cant run with both.

Ha, were lucky to be a grain of sand in the universes hourglass. Hes heavy hitting now  sending them far and deep. I hear ya, Frank.

That moment where you were the big star at the Florida beach on a summer day. He just looked up at a passing white cloud. You know, I didnt do anything wrong, or even remotely threatening.

I bent down and ran my fingers through the sand and silt in the small plunge pool under the end of the pipe. What are you searching for? Kirk intently asked. Franks pocket watch, I most matter-of-factly stated. Did he lose it right there?

His life had become an hourglass, and the sand was running out, grains slipping away.

So it was that under a little duress, Abram, with Sari, her personal slave, four goats and a few things, including a tent, did set off from his fathers house in Harem to cross a few fields and sand dunes to get to a new land.

After two years of the company training camp, Sally was walking along the beach in her one-piece bathing suit still dripping from a long swim wondering why she was itching to pound someone.

The sky was blue, the ocean was green and the sand was white and there was no one around to bother her.

She tried not to fret about it and watched the wet sand and the gentle waves wash over her toes as she splashed quietly along.

The beach was nearby as well as a pleasant park right next to the water.

They would go to the Hard Rock Caf for a burger and fries or chicken wings before going back to the beach to take the rest of the day off.

Then back to a beach to walk up and down and watch a few sun sets. Should I book something for tomorrow then. Sure.

They were delivered to a beach in the rubber dingy a few miles up the coast and walked along the beach to the hotel.

Then she sat on the beach and let the dawning sun dry her clothes and the items she had from her dead parents.

Minus the parties and the cocaine. What about you. My mother was born in Georgetown. Which Georgetown. Just down the beach in the next country. How many George towns are there. About a dozen, Id guess.

And they talked among themselves in their tent on the beach in the evenings.

They were high enough up so that the traffic noise was minimal and the murmur of the waves breaking on the beach was soothing.

Psychologically it is justified, and it is possible to understand: a man is just a grain of sand in the whirlpool of passions of the universe.

Should just close it up and move down to the beach and watch 	all the young pussy bouncing around in bikinis. Hey, you got to do what you got to do. Sergei put on his jacket as he prepared to leave. You might as well close up at ten.

The rest of the museum will have to wait for another day because I have decided that there is enough daylight left for me to do a little beach combing.

As I approach the warning signs, it is clear from the dozens of foot print trails in the rocky sand that the locals put little weight behind the stern warnings.

Several small creeks and streams flow from the sight down across the beach and into the bay and their banks are stained black and shine like rainbows due to the sheen of oil.

About halfway across the Restricted Area, is a place where an oily creek has eroded part of the remains of what was once a dock that has collapsed, making a gentle rise from the beach up into the former depot site and after a quick look around, I pass the NO TRESPASSING signs and make my way in. Up higher now and well off the beach, I am certain that I am in the area that is marked back fill on Mr. Briggs's doodled map, I start to poke around in the thick, overgrown brush in earnest.

At the end of the second hour, we had moved to a position downstream from the flow and with sticks, we had scraped trenches so that the flow merged with one of the dirty streams as by now the water was making its way all the way down to the beach and on into the bay.

Our new vantage point allowed us to monitor the beach while we remained hidden in the brush so that if any beach combers stumbled upon our stinky stream, we might be able to take some action, but as it was a rather cloudy and cold day, no one ventured by.

A section of hose will be connected to the water drain and as the air pressure is applied to the vent fitting, the gray water will be forced out of the water drain and thanks to the rain and the swollen creek, and the lack of beach combers, all of this water will pass with no one the wiser.

Of course, nothing like that is going to happen and in all the hours I spend hiding in the bushes, only two beach walkers stroll by and even though the coring machine makes a strange growling noise that can be heard faintly even down here, they seem to take no notice.

Gene would run the diamond saw while wearing an air-fed helmet and protective suit, normally used for sand blasting operations and easily rented without questions.

It was perfect weather, for us anyway, light rain, heavy fog, a dreary gray day, perfect for keeping beach combers and others away.

It is logical to think that Dr. Torginger would have wanted to cut the I-41 loose and let it beach itself at the first safe location away from any development and infrastructure.

Feel sand tween their toes

Ill perform the first casting, and well start to break down the words and the gestures as well. Leeson sprinkled some fine sand on the fresh ink, then blew off the excess.

More notes in the margins were the results. Show me the spell in your book. I finished my last note, sprinkled some fine sand over the ink, and then spun my spellbook 180 degrees.

An angry red and orange color, the bolt was anything but natural as it raced toward the beach and the people gathered there.

He pulled himself from the sea and collapsed onto the sand where he coughed ocean water from his lungs.

He was beginning to suspect he should be locked awayor perhaps hed been killed by the lightning, and this was limbo, but the energy flowing through the sand strengthened him.

Avery spotted the top of a wooden stairway behind the house; beach grass surrounded it.

It was resisting going into a ponytail, but it didnt matter, she was only going to the beach and delaying the inevitable of seeing her mother again.

When she could breathe again, she pulled off her sand-laden sneakers and socks before tossing them aside and wading into the sea.

Theres something I have to tell you. The anger and confusion Avery felt on the beach came back to replace her exhaustion.

The original families didnt intentionally keep away from outsiders, but it was natural for them to fall in love and marry one another until many became related in some way. Are you saying the kids I met on the beach are all related? Avery blurted. In one way or another, yes. Am I related to any of them? Youve never met your Aunt Becky, who is my sister.

Avery didnt want to show any interest in this, but she had to ask. Whats the story about the birthmarks those freaks on the beach showed me? When Julies gaze dropped to Averys left wrist, Avery forced herself not to shove her hand behind her back.

Its time for your powers to awaken. Averys mouth fell open; her mother really believed she was a witch, with powers, and that the kids from the beach were also witches.

With dramatic inflections in her tone, Avery told them about the kids on the beach but left out their unearthly radiance and her weird experience with them.

Even if she returned home and stuck her head in the sand, she would always question if what theyd said was true, and she couldnt live the rest of her life without answers.

Gazing across the tranquil sea and listening to the gentle ebb and flow of it against the sand, Avery knew it was the same ocean shed grown up with, but the energy rippling off it caressed her skin.

When she lifted the Grand Canyon globe, it was solid beneath her fingers and bits of sand instead of snow fell around the glass when she shook it.

CHAPTER 14 Avery let the sand run through her fingers as she half-heartedly listened to Landon talking about her impending induction ceremony.

She should pay more attention, it did concern her after all, but the tiny bits of crystal and rock in the sand fascinated her.

Reid glided across the sand to her and clasped her arm; his reassuring touch helped calm her anxiety over what was to come.

Her feet slipped in the sand as he led her forward before squeezing her arm, releasing her, and striding away.

She realized she still didnt know them well and glanced at the beach as she considered fleeing.

We went down to the beach and helped each other do it. When every other member of the coven turned thirteen, their parents gave them their Books, and everyone who was already thirteen would go to the beach with them to help awaken their powers.

Usually, the rest of the coven was with them, but theyd gone to the movies a couple of times and spent a night alone at the beach where she sat between his legs, and he held her in his arms.

Rafts, floats, and beach balls littered the floor.

CHAPTER 34 Avery stumbled and teetered before she lost her battle against gravity and fell on her hands and knees in the damp sand with the crystal in her fist.

She wasnt surprised to find her friends werent on the beach with her.

Turning away from the beach, she studied the dunes rolling across the sand.

Climbing to her feet, Avery made her way through the shifting sand.

The blisters on her feet screamed in agony as she walked, but as she approached the fire, the crystal grew brighter until it illuminated the sand and shells before her.

He extended his hand to her. What do you think, Marjorie? Marjorie smiled as she stepped away from the group and sauntered across the sand to join Celia and Regan.

CHAPTER 35 Avery waited until they vanished before rising and wiping away the wet sand clinging to her shorts and legs.

Come now, there is more for you to see. The world shifted suddenly, and the rocks under her feet melted into a black void.  When Avery landed on her hands and knees, her fingers dug reflexively into the cold, wet sand.

She lifted her head to gaze at the beach and sea spread out before her.

She stalked down the beach before disappearing in a shimmering mist.

She reeled backward in the sand as she wiped frantically at her mouth to rid herself of the feel of him. No! she cried. I dont want this or you!

The swirling colors radiating from within the caves murky depths cast light onto the beach and across her hands.

Wallace went next. I call upon the power of the earth to bury the evil you bear! The sand and dirt covering the cave floor rose before him and coursed forth to join the other elements.

How could you destroy me like this? Adrians eyes fell to the cavern floor as he edged away, and Beatrix stepped forward. I call upon the power of the earth to bury your powers in the dirt! More sand rose up to join the rising crescendo of light now quaking the walls beneath Averys fingers.

CHAPTER 37 When she found herself standing on the beach outside the cave again, Avery wasnt sure how she got there, but she was glad to be free of the death within.

The ghosts were gone, and she was alone on the vast expanse of sand and water.

I am the one who awakened your parents and the others with a simple spell. You created the lightning? I was the lightning. Avery almost sank onto the sand, but she somehow managed to keep her legs braced under her and her face impassive.

She watched as Celia and Adrian strolled the beach together with their hands entwined and the moon shining down on them.

The memory changed to Celia standing on the beach with her gaze on the ocean while she waited for Adrian to join her.

The full moon shining onto the beach illuminated the night and lit a pathway across the ocean.

The earth beneath Averys feet trembled before sand rose up to complete the barrier.

Once the sand locked into place, their dust, crystals, and herbs also rose to join the swirling elements until a wall of color and light barricaded them from the skull.

The world in front of Avery blurred when a smoky haze rose up from the beach only a foot in front of her.

They turned as one and walked down the beach with their arms entwined around each other.

Excerpt from Book 2, The Maze CHAPTER 1 The sand shifted beneath her feet and filtered into her shoes as Avery strode down the beach.

Avery berated herself for taking the beach home when a fat raindrop hit her nose.

Avery cast a glance over her shoulder, but the beach remained empty.

When she passed Islas house, the lights spilling from her back porch cast a pathway across the sand.

Avery bent her head and speed walked faster as rain pattered the sand and slid over her skin.

It only illuminated a ten-foot circular area around her, but it was enough to reveal the shells, seagrass, and crystals in the grains of sand.

I remember being stuck in a cramped room with the curtains closed, the sun and the beach over the road, but we were sitting in that hot space listening, but not listening, to the rise and fall of his words.

She moves her hand down and touches herself and within seconds is breathing short, syncopated breaths and I see the convulsions of her orgasm pass through her like small delicate waves rolling onto soft yellow sand.

Maybe they are so stunned that Difficult Dyke is sharing that they didnt listen to any of the words that came out of my mouth. I seen my uncle at a beach cross town. Oh nope.

The last time I saw Sally, we were at the beach after a swim in the ocean.

I stayed in the sand with rage pounding in my head and drowning out my thoughts, because she had rejected my ideas for the trillionth time in our relationship.

Want some? She pushes a long straw with a white substance that looks like beach foam towards my mouth.

I step onto the hot surface of the sand and feel the heat on the top of my feet and cool hidden sand on the bottom of my feet.

Cecilia would like this place. Whats wrong with you? Cancer, Sally kicks some sand high as we walk toward the ocean.

There are a few people on the beach sunbathing, throwing a dog a ball and surfing, all those things that should be happening at the beach to other people.

Ooh, yeah baby, I pull my hand away with some effort. Youre gross. I stand up and sand from my ass blows onto Sally. Ahhh, fuck.

I could drive west to the beach instead of east to moms house and sit on the sand and watch the waves while whatever happens at moms house happens without me.

We find and join the Argolians, and then together we eliminate the threat, only then can we return home and tell the Ostriches where to stick their heads and it is not in the sand. His speech went down well, and as they left the Margueriten Federation behind them, everyone on board the starship felt positive about the future.

Wanderers talk of soil full of sand.

But under the sand, rocks hide. Rocks guide the water to the sea, Hest confirmed. So that knife-happy girl outside is right, Joren spoke up suddenly. Collect water while you can get it if youre planning a journey below the cliff. Were you going somewhere else before the Green called Hest to help us? Willow asked then, addressing them both.

Using sticks, they scratched maps in dry patches of earth, to show the position of some low hills they said were made mostly of sand.

Neamis thought the sea had carried the sand up onto the land a long time ago and left it there, never returning to pull it back into the water. To view sea, we would have to be on other side of sandy hills, he said. S right.

There were insects, spiders and mice there, but nothing larger. No sand, but this is a dry place, Neamis commented.

Steve heard the screams from the crowd before he noticed the dark shadows on the sand-filled arena floor.

He instinctively used his shield to cover himself as an avalanche of gritty sand shot up and covered him and everything in the vicinity.

The two looked like a giant ball of brown, red, and blue as they rolled over and over each other in the sand.

He lay in the sand, next to the dead monsters body and took a moment to catch his breath.

Turning, he immediately rolled out of the way as a mallet slammed into the sand, right where hed been.

There was a growing pool of red blood soaking into the sand underneath the warrior.

The dying warrior turned his head, spit blood into the sand, and then wiped his mouth.

Steve was sent flying head over heels over Clyx, where he crashed into the sand.

Silas rode up and looked down at the warrior who was still trying to get his bearings in the sand. I didnt mean for that to happen.

People began throwing roses down onto the sand floor of the stadium.

Descending to the arenas sand floor, she used the wooden bleachers as steps instead of the stone stair sets that paralleled each column.

Picking herself up, Kari choked and coughed on the sand she inhaled.

It was a person, on fire, trying to roll in the sand to extinguish the torturing flames.

A woman came over and collapsed to her knees in the sand next to the burn victim.

Perceiving it directly in front of her, she comes out of her angry thoughts into a furious race to crank up her window before being sand blasted.

We were digging a hole in the sand and you wanted to stop but I wanted to finish it and you asked when Id know it was finished and I said Id just know. Oh yeah, he said and smiled. I called it your hole to nowhere. Right, Monica said.

She told him the passing of their days together felt as if she was counting all the sand in the world.

Their words sounded fast and harsh, like machine gun rounds hitting a sand bag.

In Grunewald, they saw a wild boar in the forest by the sand pit, the boar so close they could smell its musky stench.

What she wouldnt give for him to crawl into bed with her, his skin warm like the sand under her feet on a beach in early summer.

Two single-engine planes are tethered to steel pegs by thick ropes, the pegs hammered ten feet into the sand dunes that rim the runway.

They come in many different sizes and a few different frames, but I soon notice that they are all the exact same painting, each an identical picture of a beach sunset, seagulls in the sky. I sell them to tourists for twenty bucks apiece, she says. If you couldnt guess, this isnt what my parents are thinking when they brag to their friends that their daughters art pays her bills. She goes on to say that shes been unhappy with her life, but feels foolish about it.

It, too, is a beach sunset, but not like the ones Mia paints to make her living.

Like high tide at a beach with no wind, he has worked himself into an isolated frenzy. Uh huh, that sounds really annoying. Who does he even think he is? Yeah, totally. Damn, I hate that guy. Me too, babe. Something has happened to us lately that I cant seem to undo.

I could see the individual translucent and frosted, well-rounded grains of sand roll under the screamers stumpy feet.

Letting the bullhorn fall down to brush against my thigh I ambled back along the beach to my lifeguard station.

I leaned forward on my perch to study the silent individual who sat about a hundred feet further up the beach in his usual spot.

I felt threatened by him and it was with relief that he was always gone from the beach before my shift was over and I had to make my way to the often vacant parking lot where I had to then wait for a taxi to pick me up.

Id asked to have the early shift, but my request had been declined and so I was tasked with closing the beach in the evening.

Coming to a stop in the hot sand I spoke out my thoughts, as best as I could state them, all the while feeling like a defenseless bunny in front of a devouring wolf, Sir, I know this is a free country and so as you have broken no law there is nothing I can do to change a situation that I do not like.

Im sorry if my skimpy attire is a distraction for you and perhaps what would be best is for you to pick a different section of the beach for you to sit upon.

If thats not doable then Im going to need to resign my position here and and and. Sounding ridiculous to even my own ears, I threw up my hands and stalked away down the beach and just like always I felt his lusting gaze follow after me.

With the breeze came a spoken word into my soul that had me come to a standstill in the sand, Jolana? Shaking inwardly and probably outwardly I whispered in reply, Yes God? Its too late to go home.

Be patient child and you will see. Nothing more came to me and wiping at my face I gazed around at the happy vacationers enjoying themselves in the sand and surf as if they didnt have a care in the world.

A surfer far out past the main traffic on the beach was floundering about and crying out unintelligibly.

I raced back to my station and grabbed the preserver board and tied it off before then running down the beach and plunging into the surf.

I surged forward in the water away from him only to hear his words drift along after me, Because you act like one. I began swimming then and I didnt stop until my toes dug into the sand of the beach.

Forcing myself to stop I turned to help the man bring the surfer up out of the waves and onto the beach where miraculously an ambulance was already parked with all its lights glistening.

Clumsily claiming a hold of my bullhorn I pulled it up to announce, The beach is closed.

Im sorry, but the beach is closed. There really had been no need for the words as tourists everywhere were flocking to their cars and getting the heck out of Dodge.

I sat down upon the sand abruptly.

Forcing my eyes to leave him I glanced elsewhere, only to take in the fact that the beach was entirely deserted of every last living soul that had just populated it but minutes before.

I flinched slightly as he abruptly sat down on the sand beside me.

Stay here on the beach and soon I will gather you along with your family into My everlasting Kingdom, as one of my favored children, or leave now with him and I will safeguard you in the difficulties of life ahead and bring forth good fruit of it. Feeling tears streak down my face I breathed out in brokenness, My family? With Me child.

I tugged on the mans arm and dazedly he glanced at me and feeling stripped raw to the depths of my spirit, I said, Do you believe in hell? I didnt wait for him to answer before I continued on with intensity, Well, I do and I tell you right now that youre headed straight there if we dont leave this beach right now! Again, I didnt wait for a response, but grabbing a hold of his hand, I tugged him up the beach towards the parking lot and the only vehicle left in it, his Jeep.

The jeep skidded around until its rear outraced the front, but in doing such the jeep skidded in a trajectory that curveballed through the narrow gap between the vehicles and coming to a sliding stop in the dust off to the side of the road he jammed it back into drive and with heavy treaded tires ripping and spewing sand and gravel we took off again forward with the velocity of a rocket taking off.

I didnt quite know how to put what needed to be said, but I tried, I made a big decision back there on the beach to come with you.

She saw only green-covered lands, water bodies, and some areas of rock and sand.

The next day, Tiffany called him and asked him to go to the beach with her and some friends.

Tiffany had heard that Norah and her family were going to be at the beach the following day.

Tiffany wanted to bring Stephan to the beach to find out once and for all how he really felt about Norah.

it wont help because i am too much of salt water and sand in myself

Imagine a completely flat beach on the seashore.

When a strong wave hits the beach, mounds of sand, large and small, form bumps on the surface of the sand.

This is a process of "ordering": The seashore is an open system and the energy flow (the wave) that enters it can form simple patterns in the sand, which look completely regular.

The difference between the sand and the castle is that the latter is an organised complexity, whereas the former possesses only order, brought about by simple repetitions.

Zigzagging through clusters of ground hugging plants, it suddenly turned into sand.

Looking from side to side with a bit of imagination, it became apparent they were walking parallel with a gently rolling sea of sand that converged somewhere near the foot of the mountains.

It was breathtaking to see a rippling sea of succulent plants carpeting the landscape beyond the sand.

The two realms are joined by a narrow stretch of land covered in rocky mountains and sand.

There was even a nude beach to be seen, complete with naked tourists from around the globe.

As far as we can see, there are only sand dunes.

Just a few feet from where the sand dunes begin, a man is seated at an information booth made of plywood.

Since I don't know why a vast swath of city appears to have been replaced by sand dunes, I figure I must approach the man in the booth to get the lowdown on whatever weirdness is going on here.

We basically covered everything with several stories of sand dunes, so we could always be in the desert."

Regarding the strange experience of the UFOs in Rowland Heights, my partner noted that, as it is stated in the Lotus Sutra, there are countless trillions of buddhas and trillions of entities in worlds more numerous than the sand grains in the Ganges river.

In this segment the street lives on conceptually beneath the sand.

Her waves lap upon the sand.

Caressing her body with sparkling sand burning under the sun of her gaze.

IV The sun blazes upon the beach, frying the sand into shards of boiling oil.

Stumbling on a trash-strewn beach in the shadow of grumbling industry.

Sex on the Beach Whats a newlywed to do when his wife leaves him high and dry at their honeymoon beach resort with a thousand gay men, ready and willing to party in all kinds of nasty ways?

The owner trusted me so much that she let me take one of her horses to the beach and have a race.

The wind was blowing REALLY hard, and she was having a lot of trouble even keeping the car door open, some of the groceries in her cart were nearly blowing away, and sand and tiny pebbles were blowing into the babys face and the boy baby was crying and pretty freaked out.

They approached and found it to be a dead end. Looks like we entered the wrong cave Tina turns and then the floor beneath them started to move and they were going down as the floor is becoming fluid like and moving in all directions sucking them in. James dropped the torch and sack into the liquid floor before them. Its like quick sand? Tina screams. How? asks James. I dont know.

The masked man laughs as the victim lay on the sand and is being fired at by the arm weapon.

Satyr remained smiling. Hes got an energy shield too! screams James. Everyone fire! yells Drax and all three hovering motorcycles fired their energy pellets towards Satyr and watched as they fizzled in the air before him in a larger array of bright orange lights and miniature explosions. You cannot harm me! yells Satyr as he then unleashed his fury and swung his wings wildly back and forth creating a strong wind and sand to fly around him and towards the trio of hovering motorcycles and their riders, who shielded their faces and tried to ride away, but were too late as their hovering motorcycles were lifted off the ground by the strong winds and thrown into the sands a few meters behind them. Petty humans, you are so pathetic it is not even funny.

"Whoa, she yells as she landed on the sand and crawled around.

Drax leaned over to help her up, but felt her drop disappear slowly into the ground. I got that sinking feeling! says Drax. Me too, its quicksand! screams Tina as she crawled around and is pulled down on all fours her face closing into the sand. Keep your head up, says James, as he reaches for her and pulls her head out of the sand , but stumbled onto his knees as he fell into the sinking sand. Oh no not you too, says Mercedes as she wandered around wobbling and waving her hands. We need to grab hold of something, screams Drax. There is nothing, says James. Stay calm, panicking only makes it worse, says Mercedes.

Tinas face went under the sand again. Were goners, screams James, sinking deeper into the sand. Wait, look says Mercedes pointing upward as she remained calm while still sinking slowly.

Drax looks up to where she is pointing and saw a series of blinking lights, red, yellow, purple, green blue, orange, indigo, each light from a diode embedded in the rock face above them. I dont get it? says Mercedes. Uh, it looks like Morse code or something like it, says Drax, sinking further as the sand sucked him around his waist. Can you interpret them? asks Mercedes squinting on them. I can barely see says Drax as he felt his face being submerged into the quicksand.

Then in a flash of yellowish hazy light emanating in the rock face above, the temporal wormhole appeared and fizzled above the sand.

James waves his hands back as they ride and with a quick use of his powers stimulate his psychic energy fire force that allows him to create a whirlwind of sand and debris that blow around the beasts and extinguishes the flames that give sustenance to their being so they are no more in existence.

A single drop of eyelid with a small spark falls to the desert sand and is buried and extinguished. Where are we going? asks Celia. Away from there. says Tina.

Chapter 88 One year later Time: 2013, A.D., Chronix Bay On a beach in the Cayman Islands, the waves crashed onto the rocks as the winds blew, bringing in a mix of fresh sand and salt water vaporized in the air, giving the ideal sense of comfort and relaxation for Drax, Tina, and Mercedes who lay in swimsuits on beach chairs tanning under the golden sun. Isnt it something? asks Drax. Just like that its over, after everything we have been through. It sure seems weird how things were, says Mercedes. Yeah, says Tina, Satyr is back in his universe for now hoping to inform other beasts that we are the all the same after all.

Tina soon awakens in her beach chair with Mercedes and Drax beside her. What happened? asked Mercedes worried. You were only gone for like a second. Where did you go? asked Drax curiously. James says Tina. James is alive and he just dropped a big one on me. Tina grimaces as she looks at them with a stone cold glare of doom in her eyes.

Then one afternoon, after an earth-pounding storm that reached into the bottom of the ocean and stirred up the underwater ancient sand, the smell of a rotting concretion, enveloped with the metallic smell of her treasure, beckons Ivan, who is standing at the shore, mesmerized by the force of the storm, to her precise position.

It is just a matter of identifying which sand mound is concealing the loot, Ivan says, excited and appreciative of Victors passionate interest. Well, gentlemen, as much as I appreciate jewelry from bygone eras, I do not fare well on a stationary ship battling the watery elements under a scorching sun, Suzette says, excusing herself from the maritime adventure. This is why it is important, for the sake of discretion and dehydration, that we salvage what we can at night.

Under a mound of sand and sea debris lays buried the bulk of the treasure, a chest filled with emeralds, and next to it lay the forty-five boxes of gold.

Ivan unceremoniously waves his arm over the mound to clear away the sand and sea debris.

Dip our toes in the sea, ankles lapped by waves, a wide and solitary beach the setting for our excursion by myself.

the ground a childs sand angel

I taste salt on my lips, feel the sand move beneath me, and I know, deep within these worn bones, that I am home.

Daybreak brings the dance of clouds and the ballad of sand.

I hope youre awake right now to share the night with me, because someone, somewhere, is tasting for the very first time champagne, crayons, red canyons, saltshakers, the bravest sand dunes, and the bladed bananas in all their terrestrial tartness.

The surf caressing your feet, the wet sand between our toes

Climbing the sand dunes, she squints at an amber world of infinite noons.

She follows along the crooked lines in the sand, like rivulets gone

Sand, sand.

The station was at the tip of the small beach townand getting to the beach required walking past the small mall and several street-side shops.

It looked like any other American beach town, only the shops were called different names and the different ethnicities of people made me unsure of what country we were in.

I was waiting patiently, and then it came. You know, at the end of primary school years wed all take a trip here, she said as she pointed to the small theme park and arcade lining the beach strip. This was the place to be.

Approaching the sand though, we saw we hadnt given the sea enough time and that the water wasnt high enough to wade out in.

Walking back across the busy street, we slipped off our shoes and stepped onto the less-than-smoldering sand.

The beach was crowded and the beach chairs all taken. Ben, I want to walk in the water Will you come with me as I dip my feet in? Of course!

Children rode rides at the theme park while teens, in love with their new beach crushes, walked hand-in-hand across the beach.

Like sand she fell through my tightened fingers, and I felt the hourglass wasnt large enough.

We name a tree, not individual leaves, we name the sand, not individual grains.

The water crested at her feet, exposing sand crabs and small clams.

As the water receded, she watched them burrow feverishly back into the sand. Do you see the pattern? She looked back at the map.

If the deers blood was like an ocean, this was like a tidal wave pulling Melanie down into the sand.

Today it was nothing more than rubble and sand. You do this? Preira shook his head. Stavros, he said and scratched at his beard. Impossible. Flash.

She ran, and the blood poured out from her wounds like sand in an hourglass.

It was a beach that Jena had visited in her childhood during a summer vacation.

The snow stung like sand in a raging sand storm.

With a big splash, the water mixed with the soggy sand underneath turning the clear water in a light brown mess quickly.

It had to be He slowly raised a hand, inching toward a mouth the size of a beach umbrella. Hearse saidhe bound its soul to Hollysthas how its here An you believe that fruitcake?!

For we cannot add more sand and we cannot turn the glass.

All of the sensations of his womanly form being taken on a sunny day, on a ruffled towel on warm sand, were first person and in the moment.

Oh, and the water along the edge of the beach kept rising.

Over the last thirty years or so, the ocean kept eroding parts of the beach so that land, houses and even part of a highway fell into the water.

The businesses right at the edge of the beach would have water coming in up to peoples ankles at high tide, forcing the businesses to relocate.

They always had sand bags out there to keep the ocean water from seeping into the tennis courts and the big swimming pool.

I always thought that was kind of funny; that a hotel right along the beach would need a swimming pool.

At first, the four of us would go out to the big spots along the beach to party.

The whites at the beach couldnt handle us, and the Mexicans in the bars didnt like us.

The shoots location is a grim, grey beach in West Sussex.

Rotting wooden bollards  all that remains of an old pier  jut out of the sand like misshapen teeth.

So, like, one minute youre on a shit beach in Sussex, but you take one sip of Casparian and bang Im standing in front of an oversized holiday brochure, says Betts.

And at 7:00am precisely, as the suns first rays shimmer off the English Channel, Betts is standing in front of the tropical backdrop, gritty English sand squeezing between her bare toes, a glass of cranberry-flavoured vodka in her hand.

The sand is bone-white, ribboned with black silt and seaweed.

Carved rock stairs lead down to a beach of pale sand.

I think he might have taken pictures. Where did it wash up? That way, says the woman, pointing to the beach behind her. Thank you, says Betts. Not a problem.

It cuts out of the sand on an angle and stretches across an area the size of a tennis court.

The sand has turned to glass.

The remains of crabs and dead fish are embedded whole in the glass, like stuffed animals in a museum exhibit. How could this happen? she murmurs. At what temperature does sand turn into glass? About two thousand and something degrees. A lightning strike? When lightning strikes sand it turns to fulgurite, which looks more like white coral.

Betts has one. Have you ever heard of the nargophyn? On their walk back from the beach theyd already discovered there were no references to it online, for any spelling variations.

Ive seen kids wearing nargophyn Halloween costumes. We were told one washed up on the shore a few months ago, Art says. We met a woman on the beach who said youd have photos of it. Pardon?

Are you ready for that? Art throws his cigarette butt into the sand. I dont believe you. So dont. What did they do with the missing crew members? Killed them.

She has felt it, sensed it, smelt it; she has touched its glassy imprint on the sands of Luskfeld beach and embraced it in the cold dead hands of Professor Maarten.

Shes not sure if hes disappointed in Art for his choice of girl or in her for not heeding his advice to stay away. We were sailing by the beach when we saw you both on the shore. What a coincidence.

The first box is filled with a miscellany of items: animal paws, dried seaweed, antique wind-up toys and jam jars filled with layered dirt and sand.

Her Casparian beach spread has been sighted on many a garage or bedroom wall since she burst into the public eye.

The sand is yellow, the sky is blue, and the water is mercifully monster-free.

Betts lies on a deckchair under a polka-dot beach umbrella.

Blue-green water crashes quiet and white against the sand.

The Piedmont twins, who never say no to a day at the beach, sit by her deckchair and dig their brown toes into the sand. Its official, Betts Darling is our new Style Queen, Roland reads off his phone, his designer sunglasses resting against his forehead. Lee Hansens fiance has wasted no time making the most of her now-public status, dazzling us with four knockout ensembles in four different cities this past week.

Vogue Spain is doing a double-editorial on beach fashion  one version for the physical magazine, and another swim-wear focussed version for the celebrity section of the website.

People have set up bonfires above the tidemark and are either whirling around them or sitting on the sand, staring out to sea.

Her feet sink into the soft sand.

The Spanish beach is suddenly darker, the sand rippled with shadows.

She follows him quietly along the shoreline, stumbling, her feet skidding in the sand.

She closes her eyes and takes a deep breath and remembers COURAGE COMES FROM WITHIN and when she opens her eyes again the beach has returned to normal.

Ah, there was this one party I went to, though, on a private beach in LA.

The pink walls come apart at the seams and shes on the beach at Luskfeld, and its night, and the nargophyn is breathing in the shadows, and the sea below the clouds is bubbling, and as the water stews and boils she sees in it the thing beneath the island, the true monster of Luskfeld, as big as a ferry, with a head shaped like a hammer-head shark only flatter, and dark, and eyeless.

Washed up on the beach is the remains of a boat, its wooden hull seeming to slump in the sand like a beached whale.

Her hair was burnished copper; bright, against a sea of brown and blonde, like a newly minted coin nestled in sand

Duty done, it was time to build the castle, mark a ring and excavate a moat, piling sand in the centre, packing it hard, patting it smooth, finishing with one perfect pie on the top, crenellations formed with fingers, a cache of shells in neat concentric rings, and paper flags fluttering harp, lion and saltire.

The final flourish saw you wiggling fingers from each side of the moat beneath the castle's core, inching hands and wrists and arms in the mound of sand, watching for any cracks that might presage collapse.

There followed hasty trips to the sea, froth swirling in the bucket sped to the castle, poured into the moat  repeat repeat to race with the suck of sand.

Elsewhere a red tide sweeps over the sand Driven by false beliefs Preying on the misguided Leaving its flotsam of broken stones And broken bodies And like Canute we wring our hands Knowing we cannot halt the flow

We walked out with the dog on the old sand winning road way beyond the end of the pier to the water line, ragged and indented by sand banks and marsh.

Our secret cove between mud and sand.

The voices of his brethren quietened at the noise, and the caribou on the beach turned and headed away in search of shelter from the coming storm, but still, he waited.

Daphne watched as the local ferry made its way back across to Bodinnick and drew her boat in the opposite direction until she spied, in the corner of her vision, the little sand bank on the Fowey side of the river.

Relief washed over her as she spotted her blanket still laid out beneath the tree in the distance, and the _Annabelle Lee_ hitched up near the sand bank.

Scott dropped the flippers and fish on the sand.

It wasn't what I was here for and would sooner bury my head in the sand.

He was really tired from his routine, so he decided to travel to a beach called Kapalua, where he could rest, relax and surf a little just for fun.

A girl, who was drinking some coconut water seated on the sand, was feeling the sea breeze and listening to those men laughing and only one sad and with his head down.

He helped Ailsa scramble over the rocks to a patch of grass edging the curved beach below. Lovely soft sand here, you wouldnt expect that, would you? No, nor for everyone who came here to walk straight across it.

Oh! Sheep! they said together as they realised theyd been following a track made by the animals which roamed the island. Well the sheep here are a clever lot and recognise a nice beach when they see one.

I knew this beach was here and thought it would appeal.

Kirsty stepped towards the edge of the balcony and leant on the solid stone railings gazing out to the beach beyond.

They swam in the sea which wasnt too cold, enjoyed all sorts of ball games, buried Josh up to his neck in sand and ate ice creams under the hotel parasols.

It was a very tired and sleepy family who returned to the hotel that evening. Oh heck! Kirsty said, Ive just realised, we cant take Josh in like that, he has sand right up to his neck! Kirsty found a towel and began wiping Josh down. We will have to go in the back way, Rick suggested.

A motley crowd of people stood around the bonfire on the beach in the dusk.

They held up an assortment of plastic glasses and tins of drink chatting or sitting in small groups dotted around the beach. So you got here at last then! Matilda laughed as she approached them. You must be starving! She held in front of her a platter with different sorts of sandwiches which she passed towards them. Go on, get stuck in. Theres more over yonder! She pointed in the direction of a makeshift table laden with food and bottles. Thanks, sis, Rick said, tucking into the fare. We are so glad to see you. The rest of the revellers gathered on the sand also tucking into fat sandwiches made from bread that was almost as big as doorsteps and huge chunks of cheese and sausages. Great to see you! Another chap patted Rick on the back in greeting. Youve turned up at just the right time.

As the sun went down and the moon rose Kirsty and Rick sat on a tussock of grass a can of drink nestled in the sand in front of them, watching the waves lap gently over the shore as people began slowing down and getting into a more mellow mood before bed. You know what, Kirsty said, In the hotel you said youd like to be able to pay for us to stay there more often.

The flooring there was a deep sand like substance, probably used because it was easier on the ponies feet and for the, hopefully few, occasions when riders fell off.

On the beach stands a young adult man in a black tank top, sweatpants, and a black katana attached to his hip.

Find ways of spending time together with your spouse that are absolutely free, like going for a walk somewhere peaceful (I am of course thinking of a different climate to that of Edinburgh - although we do have a beach - and it wasn't *too* cold today!) - or watching a movie (one you already own - or borrowing one from friends) - not necessarily a "romantic" one, but one that celebrates life and family and joy.

Corlu had seen maps beforethe village possessed a number that documented the canals, mudflats, and sand bars that riddled the areabut those were ordinary maps, showing useful information in the drab dark ink that was garnered from the adjuni plant stems.

A windswept beach open to the fury of the ocean would probably be even worse than the mountains.

The tiny beach amongst the lichen-encrusted rocks was the furthest Corlu had ever been in her life.

We cant just leave them after a few hours. Corlu looked down at the rough brown sand and willed herself to remain calm.  Listen.

Were agreed, said Lian, with an irritating smile.  Lets go. Corlu threw him a look of suppressed fury.  Im steering then, she said, as they threw their bags into the brachen and started pulling it across the wet sand to the water.

Beside her in the gloom of the cave lay Lian, retching onto the shell-encrusted sand. How? was all she was able to get out.

She looked over to her right, and there, pulled up on the sand, was a brachen.

Shiall and Deera picked up the two remaining bags, and then they all picked their way across the rocks and sand to the back of the cave.

After a moment, she turned around and threw herself down beside them.  We can probably just make the beach before night fall.

With the last bit of color painting the sky, they gathered a pile of driftwood and built a fire behind one of the grey boulders that littered the upper stretches of beach I don't think they can see this from the village, said Shiall, warming her back against the blaze.  But I don't know if it's wise. We have to take the risk, said Corlu.  These blankets are still damp. I know, said Shiall, smiling at her over the rim of their one cup.  I just felt like I had to say it.

As she lay close to the red and gold flames, her ear filled with the unfamiliar sound of breakers thudding on the sand, the strangeness of being away from the village struck Corlu.

They soon learned to pick out the most efficient route across the beach, walking on the hard-packed sand close to where the waves crept up.

They walked for almost three days, their muscles aching from the unfamiliar exercise of hiking across sand.

On the second day, they noticed that the beach was narrowing and the cliff face growing taller.

The sand had disappeared completely. We need to start climbing, said Shiall, stating the obvious.  This may be our last chance.  She finished refilling her water flask and headed for the opening.

Why dont we keep going? What are you talking about? said Shiall impatiently.  This is probably our last chance before the tide comes in.  She shielded her eyes and pointed down the coastline.  The beach ends in cliffs down there. You cant see that far, answered Corlu.  Why go up when there may be an easier way?

I dont see any break though, said Shiall. Its going to be a long walk before we find any river valley, joined in Lian.  Its all beach and scrubby mountainside. Well.

For as far as the eye could see stretched a desert of grey sand.

It was their third morning amidst the gray sand dunes.

And now as she lay here in the sand too weak to get up, she faced her guilt.

Her thoughts seemed to swim in and out of focus like the shifting sand as it skittered across the desert.

When she looked up, wind was rising, sending sand sailing off the top of the dunes into swirls that blocked out the mountains, the horizon, and even the sky above.

Below the shifting sand was a layer of jagged black rock.

She screamed their names, but there was no answer to her calls, just the skittering of sand particles and the howls of the rising wind.

Then in front of her, like a dream, standing firm amidst the sand storm was a stone wall and a doorway. Corlu! Corlu!  The voice came from the doorway.

Holes gaped in the back walls and ceiling, but there was escape from the sand and noise without.

Corlu lay still for a few minutes, listening to the sand throw itself against the walls in furious gusts.

Sticking out of the sand and rock were an abundance of straw-like stalks. Dead plants? Corlu had thought Deera was in better shape than the rest of them, but perhaps she had been wrong. Dactyl.

Halfway to the foothills, Corlu realized that the deep grey sand had returned and the strange black rock had disappeared.

Corlu sat down by Deera on the cooling sand as the sky turned to purple above them. Do you think there were more ruins back there? she asked, scratching at the dried paste behind her ear.

All was caught up in the light from the nearly full moon, black rock, silver grey sand, like a dark river stone inset in the frost. My aunt spoke of mountains that suddenly spewed hot fire and black rivers of fiery rock. Corlu turned back to Deera.  You think that rock came from the mountain? Yes and I think it destroyed the people who lived here.

Then she understood.  Before the fire, this was the Kytheland she said dully, feeling the dream vanish.  I understand Corlu took one last look at the river of black rock as it wound its way through the sea of sand and then picked up her sack.

The others joined her, eyes darting nervously at the surrounding trees. Ive felt it too, Shiall said.  I thought I was just imagining things, getting used to the forest again after the desert. Someones warning us, added Lian, studying the arrow.  I think we need to head further east or get down to the beach quickly. Deera nodded as she wound a piece of cloth around Corlus injured hand.  At least we can see whos shooting us down there. Maybe they own the whole area; coastline included, Shiall said grimly.  They want us out of their territory. Corlu looked over at Lian.  You see the similarities.  It was a statement rather than a question.

Eli motioned her forward along the sand.

Many began to sit down. Three times in the last month, I have been able to break through the line on the south side of the island without the guard noticing.  As the tenor of Albas voice changed, a tension began to grow within the crowd.  If it wasnt for the brachen patrol and the patrols on the beach and hillside, we couldve been easily taken by surprise. Heads turned towards a group of younger children, who shifted uncomfortably.

I see it too, but . . . There is no but, said Lian firmly, taking her by the arm again.  We have to get out of here as quickly and quietly as possible, and, in the meantime, we have to act as if were staying. He looked her directly in the face, holding her still until she nodded, just as hed done on the beach when shes been afraid to climb.

You--  She began pacing back and forth across the sand and then made for the path.

While it was true that all three of them were being watched and sometimes clumsily followed, a strange malaise had fallen on the camp, making it easier to get away to the small beach where the boat lay hidden.

Corlu looked down at the sand and ran her hand through her hair, at a loss for words.

Henry picked up on the first ring. I thought you were on vacation? I snorted. Vacation is planting my ass in the sand with an umbrella drink.

Dark He was lost and bleeding, it was dark, and there was sand in his teeth.

How much sand had he swallowed?

There was sand in his mouth, lots of sand.

And there was a face, dark as the blood soaked sand.

Breakwater It was the same beach where we'd met.

We searched for the exact place where we had stood to watch the sunset, letting our feet sink slowly into the soft, golden sand.

By the time our toes were back in the sand, high tide had come in, sweeping away our earlier footprints.

It had been difficult to care for the crossbow as she traversed the dessert--cleaning out sand, oiling the rail and trigger, waxing the strings--but now it would be worth it.

The sand was trickling away too fast.

We can see the ocean and the beach when we get to the top of the hill, riding our bikes to the church.

Two were blond and looked like stereotypical beach bunnies.

Like sunshine, koalas and hot beach hunks.

First, however, there was a moment of alarm at the sight of cliffs dropping precipitately into the sea but their ship was being gently carried by the tide and even as they rested on their oars and the more viral of their members began to contemplate visions of virgins the landscape opened up and they saw a long sandy beach fringing acres of the greenest fields they had ever seen.

He, Thor, would slip away while they were laying on the beach in their birthday suits waiting for their clothing to dry. Great gods, he said, pointing in the direction of the Eddystone Lighthouse, and while they were distracted he slipped away.

When Thor stood up discretion became the better part of valour and he slowed to allow his lieutenant the opportunity to accrue battle honours while he kept himself in reserve in case...but at that moment he realised that the pirate had metamorphosed into two Vikings and that they were hurtling back down the valley as fast as their legs could carry them dodging in and out of the cows and that one of them was quite small and possibly not very dangerous and by the time they reached the last field before the beach he heard loud and guttural Viking hollers, the boat on the beach had been shouldered into the water and both their little and large attackers were scrambling on board.

The beach was lined with boarding party boats and the captains barge but no guard had been mounted.

All that remained was to beach the boat follow ears and noses and join in the fun.

The ground made a slurping noise and sucked Narcissus down deeper into the sand.

Grainy sand. Barros looked at Bertas hands, studied the textured sensory-perception strips that ran up each finger and formed a wide base along each palm. You figured that out, too. Full Sensory Intake, said Charles Wen with a nod. Our signals mimic those of the human Surrogate.

We reluctantly moved there from a small country town when I was a skinny nine-year-old.

Work was across the other side of town and I would zigzag through as many side streets as possible to avoid traffic or the remote possibility of running into anyone I knew.

Home made by kids who had no idea how to make organic granola, somebody had just dumped a jar full of honey into a bag full of sugar into a bowl full of Grape-Nuts and sprinkled the goop with hemp seeds legally purchased at the town Wal-Mart.

Their small rural school was poor, their town was impoverished.

Chapter 4 Mike put in his other earbud and turned the volume up on his phone to better hear the streaming news coverage of some kind of riot going on right here in town at the university. Members of hate groups started the violence against students protesting the scheduled appearance of alt-right speaker, Dr. Peter Jamison.

The mummified remains of the apparently human corpse found inside the ship were carefully removed and transported in a biowebbed sarcophagus to the Lodestar command center on the surface, where the entire ravine of the Northern Narrows had become a small town dotted with domes, habs, huts, sheds, shacks, shelters and other enclosures.

We got off in a marketplace of a small town with empty market shelves and with no person to be seen around.

I raced across town to drop her off with the event sitters that the spouse group was providing today.

When we finally make our way back across town to our hotel, I see Delilahs eyes drooping.

Ill be staying right in town at the Sea Haven Inn, so not far.

It seemed the entire town had shown up for treats this morning, and we were out of food by ten.

It seemed everyone in Harmony came out to support Tara because she couldnt invite the entire town to the wedding.

She stopped to clear her throat. Weve been best friends since we met at a festival in town when we were five, and I was that shy homeschooled kiddo.

Otherwise everyone in town would know about our little secret, and we cant have that happening.

The party was in full swing when I arrived; the entire town had shown up.

The hatred Maddox has for Gina is downright comical; the town was invited, but Gina knew better.

Author Krys Adams is a small town southern gal from a tiny little town called Boone, NC.

We were stopped at a traffic light and I could feel him looking at me. That was the best sex I had in a long time. He said with a smile. I thought the same thing it was just what I needed. I replied. I thought a girl like you with a banging body and excellent bedroom skills would be fighting off bedroom applicants. He stated. No, I just got out of a bad relationship and moved back to town three weeks ago. I replied then said, This was my first night out since Im back so, no I havent quite built up a bedroom roster just yet. I smiled and he smiled too.

Shaela Camp grew up in a seaside town in the Caribbean.

Apollonius of Tyana/2 BCE-90 CE Humble, wise, and courageous, Apollonius spurned his inheritance for poverty and roamed from town to town, searching for wisdom, performing miracles, casting out demons, healing the lame and blind.

After a brief nap on their separate double beds (Barton was a great believer in afternoon naps), they freshened up then walked through the streets of the modern village (a campus town normally teeming with students but empty this weekend with students still on holiday leave) and into the restored colonial village.

With this critical piece of information secured, Barton then deftly interrogated the woman about her own past and family history, discovering that she was raised in the same area of eastern North Carolina where he was born, still had relatives the next town over from his home town of Surry.

He looked to both sides of the road for the sign Barton was reading then realized it was hypothetical, not real. Some vandals burn down your sign? The town elders are still debating its placement. Not by the landfill, I trust. Barton laughed. There actually was some talk of a sign, after the first novel got so much attention.

Becca took him out the next night, his actual birthday, and drove them to a large and very fancy restaurant outside of town called The Barn for a gluttonous meal of prime beef and abundant trimmings.

It was a warm and bright Saturday in early April and the pungent odor of the freshly plowed cornfield across the gravel road drifted through the trailers open windows. Took me and Sue to find your farm country, Allison said to Zach. Better hope your farmer doesnt fertilize with manure, Zach countered. Oh, no, Sue exclaimed. Chicken or cow manure, Suewhats your preference? Allison teased, directing a wink toward Zach. Or human, Zach added. I read where theyre spraying sewage-plant sludge on county fields. Can they do that? Long as its not for human food. Thats just great! Sue said. Move out in the country to get covered in shit. Joys of country living, Zach said. Makes my cramped apartment in town sound better all the time. Allison gave Sue a light hug as she drained the cooked spaghetti in to the sink. Dont listen to Zach.

It was a clear warm weeknight in early July, the college town was near empty in its summer somnolence, and the restaurant was not busy.

She was surely back in town by now (she had one semester left to graduate), but hed not heard from her.

Hed never seen Barton so befuddled. You knowthat little town in the Judean hills: Davids home, the birthplace of Mary and Josephs little boy. He looked at Barton with a scolding stare. Do I need to get you a Bible? Barton chuckled. The idea never occurred to me.

The original inhabitants had left for unknown reasons, leaving behind only a lovely ghost town that astounded interstellar travelers who later stumbled upon it.

The girl waited until we were concealed by the bulk of the palace itself to stop, kneel, and pull up a portion of the cobblestone road, revealing a hatch that led down into the darkness under the city. This entrance was intended to be used by the Queen, if the City of Diamonds ever marched upon us, she said. That was long ago.

Thats how we talk to each other, and work, and how we traverse large buildings and take autocabs across the city.

And the disorder was replicated on the street below: crates and boxes and dumpsters and trash, here and there, though less than Aedo had been expecting; ancient cracked pavement and walkways and alleyways at odd angles, and dark patches between buildings that might have been walkways or might not.

He left the city behind and rode through the darkness of a moonless night, finding his way by instinct.

Mrs. Sandy used to say before she left town that the dust would kick up and blot out the sky if the rock fell, but she didnt think we would let that happen.

I lie in bed, or rather I sit in the living room because Pete hates me tossing and turning, and I leave the room dark and open all the curtains, and I watch the lights of the city and think about this girl Puss getting red hair dye at the grocery store and doing her hair in the bathroom at the train station.

Along the way, they passed the town square, where a few soldiers were putting up posters of wanted men.

A few days later, when Tian Haoli was just about to sit down and have his lunch, soldiers from the town garrison came to his door.

If not for my darling Angel Nkechi, I would have left this town long ago. Ngozi was long tired of having this argument over and over again.

It was the talk of town for months.

These days, he busied himself attending weddings and town hall meetings where he was sure to get some free booze and some spare change, if a sleazy politician happened to attend.

He had now become one of the major distributors in the town and had recently married a very pretty girl from a neighbouring town.

He wonders if it's so far out of town to avoid attention, and allow for guests to arrive and leave discreetly.

I'm meeting some friends in town that might know stuff about this club, Haven.

Theyd been best friends since ninth grade, when Carl moved to Noras small town and freaked everybody out with his pierced ears and flamboyant personality, and the sticky note tradition was almost as old as their friendship.

_I really need to start running the park twice_ , Nora thought as she checked the time on her phone and headed back across town to get ready for work.

The lights of the city were visible through the trees, and Nora was reminded of an old movie shed seen once, with Fred Astaire dancing a magical duet with a dark haired starlet in Central Park.

It was almost like walking into an old-fashioned photograph; the bare trees glistened whitely under the street lamps, and even in the dark, Nora could see the frost covering the ground, adding to the strange effect.

Nora stared at the dark city street, unseeing. What?

Reggie was in town visiting a buddy, and he asked if he could stop by so we could talk.

It seemed like everyone in town had stopped by with something for them to eat, and Nora dished everything into single serving containers, labeled it all, and froze most of it.

Shed dressed carefully that morning, wearing a navy blue dress shed bought in town the day before.

A couple of times, she glanced behind her, searching the guests for Kingston, but it seemed like everyone in town was there, and she didnt see him over the crowd.

But quitting didnt come easy to him, except where women were concerned, so he laced up his running shoes and headed down town for his seven thirty start time.

No, Melody answered very quickly, and when he glanced up at her, a question in his eyes, she realized not everyone felt the same way about the small town that she had grown up in as she did. I mean I was born here.

I mean, my moms friends are raving about this new handyman in town and how he can fix anything, and my mom really wanted me to give him a call, but things are kind of tight right now with the store and all, so I thought maybe I could do it myself and not have to bother calling someone whod likely overcharge and then who knows if it would even stay put together, you know?

The last thing she needed to do was create a situation where everyone in town wanted to barter for Reids work.

Unsure if it was just the fact that they lived in a small town where everyone seemed to run in the same circles or if it was happenstance that everyone seemed to be talking about the Christmas Festival, he thought back to a conversation hed had with Michael just the night before.

The town was always beautiful, but there was just something about all of the old houses at Christmas time that made her feel warm inside. What made you choose Charles Town? she asked, quietly, turning her head so that he could hear.

Along the way, they ran into a few familiar faces and some not-so familiar ones, but everyone had a smile and a greeting of Merry Christmas. As friendly as the people in their hometown in Montana had been, there was nothing quite like the feel of small town West Virginia, and Reid was glad hed chosen this place to raise his son.

If any town could generate some Christmas magic, he believed Charles Town might just be the place.

If youd like to find out what happens between Delaney, the town baker, and Josh, the Christmas tree farmer, youve got to read _Christmas Cocoa!_

Ill let one of them suck my cock or if Im really horny Ill go to town on them, but just to get off.

"Yeah, well, with all of the other clinics going up in flames lately, this is one of the only fertility and birth clinics left on this side of town thats fully functioning.

I figured if I was in a different town I wouldnt constantly be reminded of what Id lost.

With all the clinics that have been hit lately, theres a surplus of doctors running around town with no place to practice.

Anastasia settled in a town called Oymyakon, near what's known as the Pole of Cold.

The town is in the same region as Yakutsk.

Most of the town was Russian and Creole at the time.

The town registrar believed that they didn't use the full names so that the Russians couldnt harm Alexis Alaskan family.

The people here in the town gave it to me and Peter, and we built a house on it.

He knows his grandmother and that she lives in Russia. Do the people in this town know about you? Most of them do.

It was the town council's idea that I take the old family property.

What town are you in? We are approaching Yekaterinburg. I looked at Peter.  She says shes outside of Yekaterinburg.

I love you. I love you too and I will. After I got off of the phone with Peter, Tania asked me, So where is Anadyr? Its a town not far from the coast.

How can it be that the Russian government doesnt know, but the people in this Siberian town do? Youll understand the more time we spend in Siberia.

It cuts the town off completely later in the season."

It seemed that the train was making a scheduled stop. Krasnoyarsk, the voice on the PA said after Id been watching the town come up alongside of us for almost half an hour.

Where are we? Krasnoyarsk, I told her.  I guess its a regular stop. Tania looked out the window.  It looks kind of pretty.  She looked at her watch.  You said its 9:00 here?  She paused to figure the time difference in her head.  It must be a long way from town to town out here.

Weve been going for over ten hours. Tish woke from her nap too.  Of course it is a long way from town to town out here.

Were stuck in some town that Ive never heard of.

I'd read that it was a large town of around 50,000 people, but it looked desolate when we came through. I read that your town used to mine coal, yes? I asked. Yes, he replied. It looks like a Soviet town.

Alex followed the wind circling the town and heading west with the river.

In the Hilton's dining room it was early for dinner but there was a convention of teachers in town and the place had almost filled.

From Baker's Cafe window the town sprang to life at 7:00 am.

"Errin will be out of town with me.

She noticed a man in dark blue suit standing outside the window, looking down the street and then looking at his watch.

A glance in the angled window of a smoke shop told her the squeak was just about on top of her and she could see the dark car moving so slow in the street that it drew an angry honk from a taxi driver.

Alex always drove out of town 50 miles south before making the call to check his answering machine.

For a mountain locked village commercial forces had indeed changed the shape of what was a medium sized town into a small city.

Small town people could hear mice in the walls and a conversation, however quiet, in a small caf, was far from secure.

An hour later they stopped in the last gambling town of Spotlight at an RV park and Bill contacted Delight, the premier hacker he knew from Clemson.

I say at first, for no more than a hundred steps or so had I trodden from that seemingly normal patch of street when I was grabbed by the scruff of the neck and yanked into a thin and darkened side alley.

But the fact of him being a six-foot-four-inches tall monkey in a white handcrafted Italian business suit, and given that he had just evaporated into thin air, only to reappear further down the street and bundle me into a dark alley mere moments later, prepared me to be open to just about anything.

Escape Shed run and run and run, until shed found this sleepy little town in Kerala.

Fortunately, when shed first decided to settle in the town of Cherthala, shed introduced herself to the property dealer and to the shopkeepers as Dr. Kay, which was just as well since it fit the Western image shed since adopted.

A dark ominous cloud passes over the old city of Jerusalem, and the cries of the wailing wall could be heard in the wind.

So he told the man to meet him by the fork at Katsle Creek, and it was agreed that they should publicize a decree in the town of Catlerbury, so that the multitudes should have the opportunity to witness the great battle for honor's' sake.

I only tell Brent that if Haley and Tom where that way, and given the fact that our town isnt very large, it would surely be front page news if they were swingers.

Life in a small town isnt much different than being in large city in some ways.

Thats what keeps large cities and small towns comparative: the darkness of life.

The odd thing is, I happen to be the keeper of the darkness, the tales of the city if you will.

Her last encounter had the whole town talking.

She was always apologizing for her crying. Its justwell talk about it later. Suddenly Spencer hit on a plan. Its too hot to cut grass in jeans, he said, trying to adopt a casual air. Can we swing by the house and Ill change? She frowned and considered his request.

In the end he just sat there, pinned to the seat, and finally she relented, turning onto the highway that led to their house on the outskirts of town with a wordless sigh.

They werent showering us with flowers or anything, as Id half-expected them to, but they watched us march through their town as if we were a parade.

The roads were unpaved but wide, and when two of them met, the intersection was practically a town square because traffic had cut the corners enough to make them part of the road.

It was getting pretty late, so the drivers were probably hurrying to reach town before dark.

However, the engraved birth and death dates were still legible. Frank, he was a Germanic fellow like you, I said as I motioned for him to look closer at the headstone obelisk. Look, born in 1798 in Trves, Prussia. Yeah, that town is now called Trier; its in West Germany, Frank matter-of-factly stated. You sure know the Fatherland, Frank, I said as I walked over to Mary Catherine Krons headstone and felt the engraved letters and numerals. Wow, his wife was born in Tours, France.

That made this room the safest place in town for her to be.

Neither she nor Billy noticed an obvious out of place unmarked car with darkened windows coming from the south into town as their bus was leaving.

All he wanted was to know his Dad was safe. Was his Dad safe? In November a parcel came from his Dad, said Ella, all the way from Belgium, across the sea, where the fighting was. She could see the parcel in her head, wrapped up in brown paper. There was a letter in it for Alberts Mum, and a little wooden doll for each of the girls, which their Dad had carved while he was in the trenches waiting to fight. But what about Albert? asked Matt eagerly. What was his present? It was a mouth organ, said Ella. The soldiers had stopped in a town on their way to the front line, and Alberts Dad bought two mouth organs.

Yeah, she replied. I dont miss the humidity or the small town atmosphere, but I do miss the view.

While the violent murder wasnt an everyday occurrence for the residents of the small town of Yards Creek, it also wasnt the first, or the first time Fiore personally knew either the killer or the victim or both.

Small town soap operas werent any better than big city blues.

Breeding a hypocrisy that small town living was better and safer than residing in crowded urban areas or the more affluent suburbs.

Cory paused a moment to think of more ways to torture Fiore, who just stood there taking it all in as he made it to the top and leaned his gun on a tree. Then Ill see to it that every pot connection in town cuts you off.

1 Fiore was walking down a dark road, sans street lights, illuminated only by the bright full moon sinking from view and making room for a new day.

I thought the whole town knew. Fiore just shrugged his shoulders. I pretty much stayed in-doors for a few	months after the wedding.

Ill have the town road department boys come by and cover it up. It wasnt long before Fiore could see what was upsetting his mother.

Do you think you can give me a ride to town in a few minutes, if I need one?

After closing the cabinet, Fiore looked at himself in the mirror, shaking his head, ashamed of his actions. 4 Floyd was giving Fiore a ride to town with Fiore sitting up front with him.

It was obvious that Floyd liked Fiore (one of the few people in town who still did).

Its not like anybody would really miss him. 2 Located off a highway service road, about three miles outside of town and five miles from Fiores parents house, the GASCO service station was well off the beaten path.

Looks like the whole town is here. Elle stated. Ray sure does pretty well for himself. Sara pointed out. I love all the Christmas lights. Chloe said. You see, Elle.

Ive made up my mind, and Im leaving town and going back to designing school at the end of the month.

The first to meet the intruders, a little town in England, painted swiftly with a sea of red. Mary looked into the dark metal, her fingers sliding slowly across her reflection.

I do find this interesting and using this information and the stacks of business records also included, I deduce that the former owner of this pile of crap was some kind of wheeler-dealer and the owner of a petroleum depot on the outskirts of Bremerton, Washington near the small, bayside town of Brownsville.

Have I embarrassed you? No...well, maybe a little, she said between bites. But kindness isnt something to expect around here. He smirked. Tough area? You could say so. You had a pretty good turnout this evening. She shrugged. There isnt much to do in Hamilton on a Friday night. Thats true of a lot of New York, he said. But Hamilton had you. The note of warmth in his voice piqued her curiosity. Youre not local? He shook his head. I was in town for business. Wheres home? Onteora County.

He drove through the darkened streets with great care, as if he were braced for an unpleasant surprise.

Man town past hills, no go there.

Voodoo Engine crush human town and elf trees.

Most of the merchants that Ive come across outside of town avoid my patronage. Rick smiled. Come on up and share some bread and cheese with us.

To have some measure of security, particularly if I go the adventuring route and need to store the spoils, renting a cottage outside of town would be around 20 gold every week, with all of my other expenses.

The destination was a hole-in-the-wall inn on the south side of town called The Deviated Course.

He gave me a shy smile, then said, Hop in th back mister, should be nice n soft with all th wool piled up. With a fully rested team of horses, and no need to stop for investigation, stealth, or resupply, the trip back into town was rapid.

It can be addictive however, and must be used in moderation. I grunted. And the usual way that you plan to pay him? The feline sighed. He has clients in an out of town on a regular basis.

Theres no way all of these lowlifes are leaving town just before every tourist, noble, and country bumpkin floods into town.

Everyones getting out of town cause we hear theres gonna be a body count, see?

If I am correct, Vulture Hill is about 120 miles north of a town called Franklin, which is home to the nearest exit.

He will send shipments of greyskins to attack town after town, village after village until the whole world is begging him for salvation.

Because that town or village has resources that the government wants.

If the government takes the town by force, people will start an uprising.

You go to the town of Parker, he says. Its north of here.

They decide to hide out in the town and have the Frog could pose as a cripple.

Its blend of big city cynicism versus small town sincerity, with an ultimately hopeful view of human nature, apparently had something to offer to everyone.

A good example is the film "Wild Boys of the Road", also a Warner release from 1933, that shows how good teenagers became outlaws by catching trains from town to town, in the hopes of one day finding a job.

He returns her to her new town outskirts soon after, but clearly, she enjoyed her time away.

The inflamed Mrs. Gideon also spreads the word to the ladies of the nearby town where Flower Bell is going, Greasewood City, saying Flower Bell won't even be allowed to get off the train.

The town makes him the sheriff, but as the last few have died within months, this honor has more to do with Badger (Joe Calleia), the unscrupulous bar/hotel owner, wanting Flower Bell widowed than any conviction that Twillie has guts.

Naturally, she discovers the fraud, but can't save him from the town posse, who is now convinced he's the villain.

In fact, Flower Bell takes the bandit's gold with pleasure as a reward for her kisses, and encourages the town (when he leaves a bundle of goodies for them) to do the same.

The female lead is the hero, the brave town leader and both defender against and abettor of outlaws.

In this particular scene, Dilg finds that the park benches in the town square have been removed, leading him to become upset and rally a crowd into action.

Our leading lady is addressing six men, six outlaws who have found refuge in the ghost town of Yellow Sky.

Mike and her grandfather played by James Barton have been in Yellow Sky since the town was thriving and have been working the abandoned mines ever since.

The desperation of Dude to make his big score and of the remaining gang members to take their share and make it out of the ghost town alive leads to a battle of wills and bullets.

He literally leaves it all behind and heads for an abandoned mining town so that he can cover up any circumstantial evidence that points to his role in the death of his wife Susan's first husband.

He takes Susan, who is now pregnant, to the mining town with him after convincing her that he has enough experience as a police officer that he can deliver their child without any outside medical help!

With little more than their original names to go on, since he never got a good look at these men, Vickers shows up in a small town in North Dakota and on the street, immediately meets and kills (after being drawn on, of course) the first of the three men- how he knew this one was his target was not explained.

One Westerns of note is Freleng'sWild and Woolly Harefrom 1959, which features an impressive opening shot across the town of Canasta Flats past the Last Chance Saloon and the NextToThe Last Chance Saloon and pulls into the Fat Chance Saloon where the action takes place.

If he drives across town to do a signing, approximately forty miles round trip, he uses three gallons of fuel.

A small sign announced they had arrived in the town of Ferndale, founded in 1802, population 774.

They passed large, stunning homes that looked like they were built when the town was founded before pulling into the driveway of one.

Over time, outsiders moved to the island, and as the town grew, the original families became smaller. After coming to this country, the original families settled on this island after they were accused of witchcraft and driven out of Plymouth.

Every morning, when she stared at the bare spot over her bathroom sink while brushing her teeth, she reminded herself to go into town to buy a new mirror, and every day she forgot to do it.

There have always been rumors about us in town and at school, but nobody has ever confirmed those rumors, and my first reaction to you telling more of your friends was fear, buther eyes returned to the swirling circleI have a feeling your friends can handle it and wont betray us. I trust them with my life, Avery assured her. Thats good enough for me, Rosie said with a small smile.

There were bound to be reminders wherever she went, whether it was passing the school gates, walking through the park, or wandering around the town centre.

I dont like saying this . . . he paused to scrutinise her taut face. It appears that some people in this town have a problem with you.

They had purchased flowers from the supermarket and since it was a warm day decided to walk the one and a half miles across the town to the park.

She could be out of the town by lunchtime; she could start a new life elsewhere.

Not entirely convinced that those that had bothered her werent around since the festival was taking place within a half a mile of their last gig in the town of Ormont, she maintained her guard, and ever so often scanned the individuals looking for anyone suspicious.

Jonathon broke the silence. Samantha Perez was from the same side of town as the festival.

Were you at the other side of town because of your sister?

Aside from being away from the funeral procession, it was a quieter side of town since the majority of the department stores were a distance away.

That all feels really far away from me now, even though it would take me no time to drive across town and find some of my old companions and attempt reentry into that atmosphere.

He looks like a butch dyke who is hoping for a good night out on the town that ends with some no-guilt girly action in a dark corner.

I am a good citizen who is using an internet cafe, because (a) my internet got turned off at home, not my fault, (b) Im visiting from out of town and dont have my own computer, or (c) Im on probation and not allowed to use the internet for anything like the ruining of a geriatrics attempt at infamy.

A fucking old man. Sally says she got into town this morning and has been watching Carl today.

They preferred the out of town buildings rather than those in a built-up area, for it would be easier to raid these.

Fear for the safety of the salvaged items, due to the weather on and around North Western Scotland, had the salvaged items transferred to the mainland and taken to the outskirts of the town of Ayr.

Are you stupid, surely you know that men are forbidden to enter such a coloured square? Colm quickly moved forward to explain. Please excuse them, the fault is mine alone, my friends are strangers from another world, they simply did not know. With the woman partially placated, Colm continued speaking to Mark and Jean. That is another reason why I visit the city so infrequently, what would happen if a barbarian entered her space, does she not realise that it is only safe from those she need not fear. Colm then changed tack and returned to the state of the city. As you can see from the buildings around the square, nothing gets done anymore, all we have now is talk and demonstrations.

Mark and Jean were asked to wait while the Grand Council finished speaking to Colm, so they sat down in the grand hall, as it was termed. Poor Colm, his need to talk to a friendly stranger about all that he finds wrong with Ramaria was so strong, Mark surely it cannot be as bad as he has painted, not in such an advanced civilisation? Probably not, away from the Capital city it is probably okay, but maybe this is, or was, where he spent most of his time, when not on his ship, or on Namur. Mark surmised. Is this what the Ostriches plan for Earth, if so what is happening here must be reported back to our planet`s leaders I would scream if we had to live in such a world. Jean complained. Oh Mark, this so un-alien, this could be Earth, the people could be from Earth, it is so disappointing. Jean complained.

They arrived in silent mode coming in low over the horizon, then the two Margueriten shuttles split up and moved low over the tree tops to land one mile away from the small town and the pirate spaceship.

Down on the planet`s surface the Margueriten soldiers moved in on the small town, the ones on the western edge of the town would have to cross an open space, before they entered its dusty streets.

They came to rest on a small hill, they could see the town before them, then the retreating soldiers rushed across their view, closely followed by the screaming pirates.

The pirates knowing that they were stranded on the planet, were seeking to take the soldiers shuttle, and so escape from the town and hideaway from the Margueriten military.

If only others could far-talk like Flight had done, the Forest Rats and the city Rats would be able to work together against the Harvesters.

Even more fancifully, there was also some rat-talk about city Rats overthrowing the elders of the Spice City, without any of the Harvesters finding out what was going on until too late.

There was talk he might soon become one of the city elders, himself.

He stared across his hard-won patch of heaven at the town below, at the sharp angles of the buildings touched by early light.

Mina Everton has worked to overcome the slur of being the daughter of a man who skipped town with his mistress and the town development fund.

Once a rising star, he's been packed off to the small Australian town of Failie, where he is unknown and unwelcome.

Nightstrikes name came from the fact that he was so large and black, when he attacked a city it appeared as if darkness had come early.

We will attack and take over every town and village along the way.

Whenever he was called to go out of town on a mission, he would come back and tell tales of the monsters he fought, rare animals he saw, and the sights of nature that captivated him.

A veteran warrior from a small town called Lansing wins in a battle with over 500.

And so the very next Saturday when I was off work I drove out alone on the winding dirt road, leaving the valley from the far southeastern edge of the city and travelling toward the little town of Guernivaca, Arizona.

The miserable ranches in that district tended to be the short-term obsessions of town dwellers whose interest in playing cowboys arose sporadically.

Dotties place sat way out on the edge of our desert town on a rutted dirt road.

The fact that you had to drive on an unpaved road to reach Dotties shop wasnt so unusual for those times, for even the center of town was dirt roads then.

She had her own dress factory that sewed fashionable togs, and she drove around town in a station wagon with the factory name emblazoned on the side.

Her shop failed later that year and she lived on in the pink house alone, penniless, until our town gradually grew to envelop the old place.

The summer storms were huge that year and the town had heavy afternoon rain that turned the field to mud for several days before the notice came.

No doubt he would become famous there and they would never see him perform in their small town again.

Before you came tonight to our town and made your speeches, we had never really been privileged with culture and had not received any tidbits of insight from the realms of higher thinking in the Eastern Coasts and Continental Europe.

I happen to be a member of a very exclusive club in town that studies spoor.

As a young teen, age thirteen or fourteen when I first heard your story, I disregarded the tale and considered it strange, and frankly embarrassing, that you, my very own dear mother, supposedly a well-educated woman and once a librarian in a small town on the Salomonie River in Indiana, didnt know that Walt Whitman published Leaves of Grass in 1855, which I was fairly certain was not the McCarthy Era.

Were going to use you as a librarian, Junie. He was talking about you that way because they knew you worked in the little library across from your home in the small Indiana town on the Salamonie River.

They came through town in 1956 when Jacob was transferred to a base near San Bernadino, California.

Just then, a flash of lightning stabbed the town somewhere outside the window and I scooted for the door. Im coming down, too, I said to their shadows which were already creeping up the stairwell wall like liquid ghouls.

Knowing the many dulcet and enticing Arizona place names, the various Bitter Springs, Rough Rock, Skull Valley, Wide Ruin, and Skeleton Canyon, I didnt think to question a town named Meager. Ranch upbringing, parents are wicked hippies and it was wicked awful up there in the wicked White Mountains, dont even ask me. Okay, I wont, I said, agreeably enough.

I watched those leaves scatter on the surface of the canyon stream and meander around boulders, past cacti, and tumble toward the desert floor of our valley, miles below, and our town was all a dusty blur that day.

One summer when Stephie and I were both back in town for a wedding, we decided to go down to the tracks where Dad was killed.

We hadnt been back to town since Mom died, no reason to return.

We werent at a crossing, not close enough to town and too late at night for warning horns or flashing lights.

Soon, people from town started dropping by in their Honda Civics and Jeep Caravans to look. Mr. Michaels, Monicas old English teacher came by. I didnt know you were back in town! hed said, like it was a good thing.

My father calls him the town drunk. Who will look after me if she dies?

After an hour I tell my father Im not sure they are still up there. He is still propped against the car, rubbing dirt onto his boots. Dad, maybe Mr. Haraldson crashed the plane. No, he replied. Hes sober. I listen for a lawnmower and finally see a sharp glint in the sky, moving slow and steady, like the satellites passing over our town at night.

We drove out of town to the straight stretch of highway to launch it.

We reach the store on the town square, and a bell dings as we enter.

Far below, our town sprawls like a miniature village around a train set.

Dantanian placed the map back into his jacket pocket, Its odd - every single legitimate town should always be marked.

Shed been working at this shady tavern for two years since then, so it was no surprise how busy it got at that time, and it wasn't like there was another place to get pissed in the small town - Loray.

She grew up in this small town all her life - eighteen years of it should drive anybody to the point of madness of wanting to see other places.

All it did was raise suspicion  like this town didn't have enough of that already, courtesy of their conspiracy theorist-lunatic of a mayor.

This town finds it difficult to accept strangers.

The tension in the air rose, a calm wind skimmed through the area, sweeping up clouds of dirt  the tall trees on their right gently waved and the joyful child shouts from the town behind them zeroed out of their minds.

The two brothers eventually made their way back to the town Inn, where they ate their fill and Jericho took a nap in his rented dorm when night fell.

The small dorm was pitch-black at this time of morning, only slightly illuminated by the full moon cloaked behind the thick fog that surrounded the town of Loray.

After leaving the town of Loray, the beaten paths led to a wide-open road of tar as far as the eye could see.

The man stretched his finger to the middle of town and Liatha immediately mounted her mare and followed, not wanting to waste any time.

She visited every town within fifty kilometers of proximity with no avail.

This side of town was a lot different from where Jericho previously experienced.

Currently he is out of town for business.

Theres no time to waste, Jericho said as he slammed his magic into the investigating guards outside his cell. Ill pick up my sword from the armory first, and then head out to the nearest town for a Warp Crystal.

After seizing a horse from the stables, Jericho made his way to the nearest town in the vicinity  Fansen.

The streets of the small town would usually be dead at this time of night, but the deafening siren in the distance made it impossible for anyone to rest.

Baals severed arm became shrouded in shadows and flourished with regeneration, he stretched his arms out and conjured a cluster of darkness, the red tint from his magic basked the city in its glow and the magnitude from its essence shook the ground beneath Jerichos feet, it is the divine power _ripped_ from the very Heavens themselves!

To anyone else looking at this scene, they would see only a dirty, dark, and dismal city landscape, a type not unusual in the midst of any city.

I guess it wasnt much of a camp, more like a hiding place where we cowered after dark, listening to them as they ravaged the town.

The morning sun found me back in town searching for food.

The walk into town was longer, but it had to be done.

The town they moved to was a white town.

We recently moved to this town because of my dad's work.

He hadnt been there since he moved to town two months earlier.

Richie Davis, a thirty-year-old divorcee who had recently moved to Estelline a small town twenty miles outside of Childress, Texas.

Driving past the park in our darkened neighborhood I notice a street walker and I think I could bring him here and spend $60 and get his cherry popped.

It was as if a tiny town was captured inside a bottle, drifting out to sea. Tam, the governing committee is hailing me.

As she walked the dark and muddy streets snow began to fall on her head and shoulders.

I know, I saw it myself. Times have changed, Lillien, Grenorl calmed the elf, We would pose as out of town merchants looking to invest or deposit in the bank, that would get us into the vaults where we would crack the two vaults and leave as quickly as we can. Wait, Belfur cut in, Two vaults?

Although the skies were dark and the streets lights shone dimly through the light fall of snow it was still early in the morning.

Apparently the Lord of Bregta attacked Tyn and failed, and the Lord of Tyn responded in kind with the Lord of Hollenfll joining him. Who won? Lieut asked absently, his thoughts elsewhere. Neither apparently, Vythe replied, An arm of Elder Races sacked the town of Bregta along with all the armies.

The atmosphere soon turned dark though as news came from outside the city walls. I have seen it myself my King, a strong knight said as he knelt before the throne. Woodlands, Ledolm, Calias, Bregta and Waifald all in ruin. The knights news brought much concern to the Kings face and the hall erupted in a murmur of despair. My scouts say that King Haron has reached the town of Hollenfll with a great host, the knight continued, But that is not the worst of the news. The knight stood and emptied the burlap sack that had been at his side and half a dozen heads fell onto the white marble floor. Djarcs, someone gasped as that dark skin and twisted features of the heads fell for all to see.

The first town they came to was Woodlands where much of the forest had been burned and the township was nothing but a broken shell, empty and dead.

They still searched the deserted town and surrounding woods for any survivors, but a day later finding no one, they were on the move again.

On the tenth day out from Crydon they finally came to the sea side town of Waifeld.

Confidently King Lienthor rode his horse up to the gates and shouted loudly. Let it be known that I, King Lienthor, have come to the town of Waifeld, the King shouted, I bring food, medical equipment and relief for all good folk that hear me. The Kings call was replied with silence and for many minutes the King sat upon his horse before the gates.

That night the army camped around the walls of the town and the King stayed at the keep.

I do hope you have been looking. Of course, Kildar smiled, But our enemy is cunning, secretive, and leave no witnesses. Sounds like you, Garlin replied seriously and Kildar laughed. But I would know better than going against the greatest warriors in land, Kildar smiled. We Wyner will not be cowed like this, Garlin shouted angrily and slammed his fist into the table, Damn it Kildar we will destroy them before we return home. Kildar nodded, I will double my efforts. Dont leave yet, Garlin said as Kildar began to rise from his seat, There are other problems I wish to discuss with you. Of course my Liege, Kildar nodded and sat back down, What troubles you? There is discontent within our ranks, Garlin said seriously, They make friends with the lesser races here in the city and there is talk that they want to stay in this disgusting land and not return to Nevrance.

Two warriors moved to collect the body of their friend, but Garlin stopped them. Do not burn him, Garlin commanded, Put him on a spike at the centre of the town so all remember who their King is. The two warriors nodded stiffly and obeyed, but Kildar could see the hate and defiance in their eyes. Can you believe such a low class warrior would challenge me, and think he would win? Garlin scoffed as he came over to Kildar. The Programmable Biotic Entities on your brain stem helped then? Kildar replied, his face expressionless.

This realisation had put Baelor in a foul mood and he spent his time brooding in the castle while the rest of the army mulled about the town of Bregta in boredom.

Sick of the waiting Elardre had commanded many of his Djarcs to wander the land as well as attack the town of Waifald.

They are ageless, but not immortal. Raith nodded, And how do you expect to kill The Five, when you could not before? A dark cloud came across Krehas face and her childish demeanour changed suddenly, They were prepared for me the first time, this time they will not be. Raith looked away from Kreha and back across the city, nothing more was said for many minutes and Raith soon realised that Kreha had disappeared again.

For the rest of the meeting the Lords continued to talk about matters within the city.

Looming behind the vast army stood the ruined city of Gun drin nestled at the feet of a tall mountain, and about its peak dark clouds whirled. May The Five save us, King Lienthor said quietly, What hope do we have if Baelor refuses to negotiate? He will see reason, Rook reassured the King, and herself.

Even in Lancer Kildar had heard about the destruction of Midway and he was very surprised to see the iconic town looking as if nothing had happened.

Although the control of town was now completely in the hands of the Baron of Issia, and it seemed that the Lords of Port Nabrath were not about to oppose it.

But now people can look up most places in town with a basic search.

Why?! <click> At that very moment, Cliff passed the halfway point of historic Route 66, just off to his right in the small town of Adrian (TX).

But, get this: He then helped some lesbians open up a bar on the other side of town called Womentalities. Huh? Youre shitting me. Hes got to be pulling my leg. Nope, the bartender stoically replied. The city residents are pretty much ok with it now, but tourists who just see one without the other sometimes get bent out of shape.

Yaiza has a very large town square and so armed with (in)appropriate music loaded onto my phone, each night we strolled to the square, fired up the music in my shirt pocket and tangoed badly to our hearts content.

Since I did not feel like telling them why we would not ease our troubles by getting a free ride into town with them, I made some lame excuse about needing more exercise.

How odd that such a wonderful natural phenomena should occur in such a nondescript part of this city, a part of town which is otherwise almost colorless and coldish looking.

I was on the bus home, having gone into town after school.

I was 18 and traveling to a town about an hour away alone on Halloween and stopped at the local Walmart to grab a couple things.

7) bblandest wrote, Three years ago I was cycling home from our local pub through the center of our sleepy south coast town and about six men walked out into the street and started shouting, surrounded me on my bicycle, and started grabbing me around the waist, and one held onto my hands on the handle bars.

When I was seven, my parents let my older sister and I ride our bikes about 3.5 miles into town to get lunch at the only restaurant in town, which my moms cousin owns.

Once she was visiting him for out of town and he had gone somewhere.

One bar in town got rid of a biker gang in the most genius way.

Anyways, I would get really freaked out being in that building by myself with the doors unlocked: It was in a bad part of town and anyone could just walk right in.

My university town had the highest incidents of sexual assault for five years in a row, the school and community took it really seriously and implemented procedures all over the place.

My friends did, though, and they said it was a relief to be in a bar that took womens safety so seriously because in other bars in that town you could pay a bartender $20 to spike a drink.

A friend was passing through my town and I hitched a ride, then used a complicated series of rides and couches from other friends to stay away from my parents house until my mom was at work and Id had a chance to get a few hours of sleep.

I was horribly depressed, but always cheered up when he and his wife came into town to take pics.

And she said shes in town to visit family for Christmas, shes leaving tomorrow to have the new year with her friends.

The darkness of night soon dominates the small city, which is a rundown community in a major metropolitan area, on the eastern seaboard.

Chapter 3 Police cruisers with sirens wailing loudly light up the vicinity of the museum as the dark skies are partially obscured by the street lamps that burn with vibrant luminosity.

A blue Lincoln town car pulls up with U.S. government plates, its headlights shining into the scene like a beacon of hope. Wait up, says one of the suited men about to enter the museum as he runs back towards the town car.

Her hair is dark with chestnut and blond highlights and is tied in a knot, behind her head. Tina May," says James, his hoarse voice barely forming the words, Tina May Prescott, is that you?  He notices her head turn, her dark brown hair and pale complexion glistening in the open street lights. She is very beautiful!"

This breaking and entering job at the museum really put an extra spin on things says Brock. Well it isnt each day something of this magnitude happens in a town as isolated.

I bet everyone in town is a bit shaken up says Adam. I know.

That night, Sylvia walks along a dark alley taking a shortcut home down the mean streets of downtown Chronix Bay.

We are kind of low on funds right now says Tina. Lots of varmints in town got what you need.

The duo smile at each other, listening to Melville as they are extremely grateful when he let them off in a small town outside of Chronix Bay called Radcliffe population 2001, but we're not sure about the 1 according to the sign on the outskirts of town.

How can we escape out of town? asks James. We can find a more suitable ride into town and get to the train station.

Chapter 30 Broad Staffnight and his entourage arrived as their limousine descended out of the dark tunnel from their metropolitan centres to the downtown Chronix Bay City Airport area, and they were shocked at the people occupying the city streets.

That seems to fit the adequate definition of homeless and destitute says Tina nonchalantly. Im used to living on the streets as I spent most of my adult life walking around the streets of this God forsaken town and seeing the same stuff over and over again, looking for food in trash cans and dumpsters, or just struggling to find a place to put my head down for the night, usually a cardboard box. I know.

He takes out his cellular phone, a specially-designed communications array hooked up to Temporo, Inc.s computer networks and camera systems throughout town including the airports.

The driver explained in Portuguese that he could not continue. This is a tourist area, but I will not go over there yells the man angrily in Portuguese. What did he say? asks James. Hes afraid to go there. Tina explained. Can you take us to a town or something? asks James.

He is frightened. Come this way, this way sirs and madam, he smiles at Elizabeth, this is the market of the town. He pointed to a shanty town of scattered wooden homes, old clay huts, and fruit stands surrounding a clearing, the vegetation and trees form the woods offering a quaint backdrop to the rustic commerce and exchanges of everyday life. Wow, this is totally different from the capital where we landed into speaks Elizabeth. Come on.

This town is safe.

She is a tall, pretty woman of Mexican descent, with a mocha complexion and dark brown hair, who speaks with a slight accent even though she is an American, born in the United States to middle class parents who had earlier in life struggled to escape poverty in a poor town near Juarez City.

There isnt even a church nearby. She did not want to fall asleep in an alleyway in such a dangerous part of town so she walks for miles until too tired to continue as daybreak begins.

Chapter 54 The next day at early morning, the rooster crowed over the small town of Javierita with a loud cock a doodle doo, awaking everyone and beginning the bustle of movement in the town square edging on through the busy day.

Im done with my chores so Im all yours tonight, she adds. I got business meetings with some colleagues. Oh OK. she nodded and walks away and sits down at the kitchen table. Im sure I will find something to do tonight. You can go to the movies in town tonight.

Chapter 55 In a darkened empty warehouse, far from the town outskirts, a group of warriors dressed in the ninja garb worn by the church attacker gathered before a single small television monitor that suddenly came to life with images before them and snow fizzing on the old quality set.

You want to kill me? She began to cry. Its complicated. Juan Carlos uttered, and looking at her teary face he started to cry himself. Do it, cousin if you really want to be part of el Culto! Screams Julio as he exits the vehicle with the others except for Juan Carlos as the others ran towards the far end of the town where the creature has landed and begun to wander. Kill her, Cousin, yells Julio in Spanish as he ran off with the others, armed and ready. You want to hurt me. Mercedes looks Juan Carlos in the eyes and with tears in her own eyes, she began to back away. I dont ever want to see you again. No he grabbed her I dont want to hurt you.

Chapter 59 Weeks later, the streets of Chronix Bay were littered with the remnants of ticker tape, balloons, and confetti after a grand parade in honour of the heroes who had saved the town from the beast.

The local newspaper reporters were reporting it as a miracle from God and some people in town were talking about government cover ups and other worldly visitors, while others were grateful they survived.

In the midst of the central tower complex on the top floor, a meeting takes place that projects the hope and vision of the future of the city. My friends, speaks Milton Drax, brilliant legal scholar, thrilling adventurer, strong minded advocate for the wealthiest of citizens, and chief legal officer of Temporo, Inc. We are gathered here for one of the noblest purposes, participation in a quest unlike no other. He is a man of excellence and fame, dark smooth hair, thin moustache, large scale ego, brilliant mind, and whimsical personality in his shiny expensive custom made suit and tie.

Later that evening, Drax walks out of the hotel smiling and dressed in a colourful tropical shirt with trees and skies, a mountain top, and he walks about this new town, below the yellow sun and dark blue sky, a warm summer breeze and white clouds streaked across the endless sky.

He stepped into another cab and rode to the far end of the other side of town as he held his golden compass.

As they exit the castle, they look up at the sky and saw beams of light fly up and through the air around the town morphing slowly into three gruesome and ferocious beasts one a dog with three heads, another an eight-headed dragon, and the final one a large amphibian long-necked creature.

The three beasts roamed the town landscape rampaging stores and breaking through glass windows and stomping the stone cobble walkways as they roared into the mist menacing the town's citizens.

Tina turned and ran towards them, but is apprehended by one of the other men who now pinned her down and bound her arms behind her back with rope as well. Uh she muttered as the man with the sword approached and reached into her pocket pulling out the green emerald object, its light reflecting brightly off the clear starry sky. This is what we wantthis is what we want he speaks in Spanish with a dark and sinister voice as his cold dark eyes glared into the cantered five orbs within the object shimmering in the light pole on the street corner. What do you want this for?

She stayed there and did odd jobs for a while saving up some money before the work dried up, then she wound up leaving and wandering around until she found her way into a small dirt town on the outskirts of Florida.

She walks down the street hearing a sudden commotion in the distance, a loud roar of individual screams and wild laughter followed by dark crinkled voices screaming in Spanish, kill them! and  Find them now! Mercedes saw two people in their mid-thirties run out of the alleyway near a bank, a man and a woman with a box under her arm.

They ride forward along many miles and stretches of road not heading in any particular direction, but trying to get as far out of town as possible.

He retrieved the time stone and knew now that he needed to get in there as the top secret projects and technologies would be kept there and he needed to get a hold of them to get out of town and leave the machinations of his former employer once and for all.

The shadows of eight men wander into a warehouse positioned and long-since abandoned on the wooded outskirts of town, each wearing black glistening and loose-fitting jumpsuits with masks and a dark red sash around their waists with the golden metal plated symbol of The Culto De La Piedra Tiempo.

The eyes look up as a woman with a black wardrobe, long gown, and tall multiple-horned and crowned headdress stands up, her face pale like a ghost, her eyes dark like coal, and her nails long and black like onyx. Justice will know no bounds for the wicked.  The woman touches the Time Stone that glistens brightly before her, placing a sharp index finger nail on the precious ancient crystal and an aural window of energy emerges revealing a scene far away, four people in the wooded area of Chronix Bay. Window of Time, show me my foe, Window of Time, show me their woe! She looks on speaking vibrantly as she sees the familiar faces she recognizes from many adventures before. James Timewalker, Tina May Prescott, Mercedes, Gonzalez, and Milton Drax. She looks on at the foursome before a sign reading Welcome to Chronix Bay with the word Chronic replacing Chronix by graffiti artists vandalizing the citys welcome sign.

Then suddenly a glowing dark blue light with electrical light and orange colours fizzles in the street outside of the alley.

Chapter 69 James walks along the road near the town square and suddenly stops in a frantic malaise.

A flash of blue and black lines vibrated intensely before him, a tunnel of energy fast forwarding him to another place and time, a city dark and mysterious, tall skyscrapers not unlike any major urban metropolis and lights of various colours of the rainbow spectrum on the front and pinnacle of each building, a large dome-shaped citadel structure in the middle.

The town is surrounded by an encampment of tents and small shacks built as temporary shelter by inhabitants.

A small group gathers around one of the larger tents on the outskirts of the shanty town and holds a small town hall meeting. We need to enforce stronger limits on our aqueduct use.

------------------------------------------------------- The next morning the sun veered over the darkness of the shanty town as the skies were a mix of black and blue, darker in some areas than others, but brighter over most areas above.

You always were like an uncle to me when I was coming up. Only reason is because of your dad, I miss him sometimes, he saved my life in the great conflict, and he was a great friend and great person. I know, she smiles. He would have been proud of you just as I am.  They embraced briefly.  Ready the men he smirks I will let my superiors at Union HQ know we got a rebellion to reconsider. ----------------------------------------------------------- Meanwhile, far above their small shanty town, in the high peaks of the city middle where the old Chronix Bay once stood, the tall ominous citadel historically occupied by dark forces now is occupied by even darker and more sinister beings that dwell within it.

I thought we were going to go back to our own time says Tina. I know it looks like we overshot the mark by about a century or so, but cant figure out why says Drax. Maybe we didnt think hard enough in the vacuum, joked Tina. Hardly amusing. says Drax. What do you suppose happened to this town? asks Mercedes. It seems that the increase in domestic generated pollutants have caused a cloud of darkness to permeate the atmosphere says Drax walking with his hand held scanner. I am picking up an increase of carbon monoxide emissions in the air.

The foursome walks into the central square of the town being eyed by the locals curiously. I think we need to get some new clothes Mercedes says. Yeah, I just realized we were wearing the same clothes since the last Time we were in, says Drax. Lets see what we can dredge up. Dont think there is an open Bloomingdales around here laughs Tina. Hmmm says Drax as he noticed a beautiful petite young woman with short hair wearing a leather jacket approach them. Welcome to Lightning Way! She smiles. Thanks says Drax extending his hand and gripping hers firmly. What a grip, stranger.

It is lost long ago in the dark forest and would prove extraordinarily resilient in facing our current dilemma. Whats that? asks Drax. We are being exterminated by a ruthless villain who dwells in the towers above the city and who is the source of chaos during the Great Conflict, the United Regiment of the Oligarchy.

Chapter 75 The darkness became the air over the citadel in the middle of the city.

Within the central chamber rested a group arming themselves and preparing themselves for the ultimate apocalypse that is pending to bestow itself onto the streets below. That could take us to another place says General Stormy to his subordinate, a man with glasses and a crew cut dressed in the dark grey uniform of the Contingent Elite Command.

The soldiers heralded their armaments with decorations and have shields with an emblem of a lioness wearing a crown. Who goes there? The leader yells, a tall man with grit and slight wrinkles upon his face. We mean you no harm, yells Mercedes as both she and James raised their arms in the air. Come with us! the lead guard screams as the guards seize the items they carry and escort the duo away from the clearing they landed in and towards the shrubbery of the forest to a trail that they see leads  to a tall castle of ancient stone. Beautiful says Mercedes. I know says James, I saw it before in a vision, looking up at the grey stonework walls and dark grey caps on the tall towers looming over the woods and nearby town like a leviathan.

They all escape into vans parked outside carefully concealed to blend into the fabric of the dark city urban streets.

James looks down the hill at the town in the valley below. And about the time stone, Im sure that there are probably safety measures we havent learned about yet, but for now its dead.

So, lets get moving. They sigh and walk through a valley to the town below.

Youre awesome! In solitude in the well lit room of Valandir Mansion in the far end of the small town below, an isolated house that loomed like a monolith, a lonely figure sits in a large chair in a room adorned by the candlelight of multiple candelabra and a mantelpiece with a bust of Shakespeare, amongst a scattering of old world relics and artefacts.

He wore a red velvet robe and held a pipe on which he was puffing away. Soon the time will come. He says to himself over and over every night as he waited to fall asleep. Well, according to the local newspaper, the Flintown Gazette the date is March 18, 1947, says Drax, reading the headlines, Local affiliate buys out town treasurer.

One has extra hair on his face near his eyes, another with a wrinkled extra limb on her body, another with small blue orbs on his face and bear arms and legs, and yet another exhibited superior agility and speed in his rounds as he has a long furry tail curved around his right leg. They are all human-beast hybrids, says Drax with a shock. This whole town is apparently, says Mercedes.

Chapter 87 Time: 2012, A.D., Chronix Bay Around the city of Chronix Bay, there are sirens and lights from police cars wailing as federal agents suited up running about and hovering about the scene of a gruesome series of bloody murders. What do you got, Mac? asks Adam, the FBI agent, a smooth-talking man in a dark grey suit with his hands on his hips and dashing smirk. Seventeenth woman this week, killed and totally the victim of exsanguinations... you know drained of blood, says Mac, a chubby balding man in a cheap suit holding a white box and wearing white gloves. So were still hunting count Dracula. says Adam. I dont like this.

I think I can find a way to disrupt them. Alls fair in love and war! She is responsible... for the dark storm and everything... the world without love! We need to stop her! A Pregiver space-time witch with a god complex, wow! And back in the city, the news shows rival companies continue chaotic reign with mystery vigilante on their trail as dark matter surges and cosmic storm brews on the horizon.

It all began in the ancient past, three hundred billion years into the past on the small moon-sized atmospheric world called NOGG that immersed itself with natural-forming darkness over the shimmering golden lights of the city skyline scraping the skies and stretching out completely in rows and lines across the entire planet.  We have to find the relic known as the mighty oculus of the Magenta-Subset of the Pregivers says Mercedes as it is the glue to joining the six stones of the cosmos! Where to next? wonders Drax looking around. Look at the clues says Tina eyeing the jewels before them forming a strange shape with scenes glowing inside of animals running and plants in a plain field growing wild and free amidst the ancient primal ancestors of man in tribal formations under a hot large oval of a sun ball above hot treacherous sands and dangerous jungles of the dark continent.

And this can only be overcome with the virtues of humanity, courage, compassion, and kindness or the biblical Christian gifts of faith, hope, and love! Mobius speaks philosophically and peacefully. The temporal wormhole is a gate in space and time for those who want to leave their own worlds behind says Mercedes. But for those who wish for a better life must often learn that sometimes the best life is what you already had says Mobius. Is it our fate to be traveling endlessly like this one trip after another? wonders Tina. Perhaps it's the journey that determines our fate not the destination says Drax. That is part of the hero within each of us! There is an old Native American legend down south, past the Yucatan Peninsula where people tell tales in a town of ancient tribes who used to breed horses to be weapons of light with superior fighting abilities and skills that would be around for all of time! Mobius tells the Time Stone Team with his dying breath on the battlefield. Find them in time! Never give up on us no matter how rough Tina whispers to empty space hoping James hears from the outsiders dimension just as she sees a shooting star falling knowing he was there. The next time is the better time says Tina, like James said.

Out of this small town and into the big city.

Most, with the assistance of the Ursuline nuns, marry quickly, while others, not too happy with the mudhole of a town lacking in wine, cheese, wheat, and meat but overflowing with seafood, will not marry until they decide if the New World is for them.

Suzette is the envy of the town for marrying the richest man in New Orleans while wearing a Parisian wedding dress embroidered with gold, diamonds, and pearls custom designed for her.

Despite being shadowed by his presence around town in the last few weeks, the depth in his eyes inspires confidence in her toward him.

Their friendship disheartens many of her wishful suitors, and whisperers around town are consumed by the friendship between Ivan and Suzette.

The sisters are not comfortable that Suzette, a wealthy widow, lives in a frontier town alone, save her slaves.

Because of you I know love, Ivan says, holding her. How did you meet Henrietta? Suzette asks I was new in town and I lost my way, and she guided me, Ivan says. Did you have a relationship with her? Suzette asks. No.

After dusk Suzette and Ivan go into town to administer to the sick so they can feed off the bloodletting patients.

And, like you, I am not afraid of the sea, Suzettes says. I see this town is very well informed.

Under the warm and bright glow of the gas lamp, they study the map. If you are still in town next month, you are welcome to join me on my next treasure hunt, Ivan says.

The talk about town is mostly benign; after all, the public appreciates what they mainly seeIvan and Victors philanthropic standing in the community.

My servant is on his way to fetch two more horses, Suzette reports as she holds back the joy in her heart to see him. My dear lady, you will catch your death in the rain, Victor says, clearly concerned. My lady will not wait in the coach, says the concerned coachman as he continues to cover her with the umbrella. I am on my way into town for dinner.

Suzettes heart pulsates with happiness, her body relaxes with relief as she settles into her chair, and she smiles at Victor and she says to him, I cannot express how happy I am to hear you are not leaving town soon.

That afternoon she goes into town to have lunch with Ivan with the hope of running into Victor.

New Orleans is still a young and intimate town where peoples pastime is to take note of those they run into and pass on commentary to one another about the people they see walking about town.

Victor had left town earlier than expected, he cheerfully thought.

And while the joy that Victor had left town invigorates him, he cannot ignore the stabbing worry of how it will break Suzettes heart.

Ivans conflicted eyes confuse Henrietta, and then Ivan announces, Victor left town at daybreak, and I am worried about how Suzette will handle his departure. Do not burden yourself with worry for her, because Victor did not leave.

As she dusts their resting ground with lime, she feels utterly grateful that Victor left town for business prior to the bad air. This August is the most heartrending August of my whole existence.

I calmed his worries; I told him the good Doctor Suzette and Ivan are in town helping the dying and the dead. Suzette relaxes and she says, Thank you. You are very welcome, my dear.

The kind found in the charm of a small town or on the face of a still lake, reflecting the sunlight, making it dance around you.

Its the small caf in a town of 251 people, the waitress charging me $1 for three cups of Maxwell House Breakfast Blend, throwing out a Hey, honey at every turn.

The son took the axe, went up on the hillside and chopped enough wood for a load to carry to the town on the other side of the hill.

The pearl-white Mitsubishi 3000gt stood for the pride and joy I strutted around town with.

As the sun bid us adieu, the outer world began to get darker and cooler; and I noticed how the vibrant city lights and hurried people began to slow and dull.

These steps led to a broad, flat area of grass that I assumed could be picnicked on during the day. Lets sit here and look at the lights, shed told me. Isnt it all just so lovely? Itsamazing, I slowly let out. But the one thing missing is the color of the water and the sky. Whatre you talking about? she questioned as she glanced upwards, understandingly noting the brown color of the River, now mistakenly masked by darkness.

Getting off the train, I noticed that this small town was quiet and quaint as was Grays; and the stillness surrounding the station made for the most ideal setting.

For the darkness London knew, it was obvious that darkness alone wouldnt be enough to take down this citys spirit.

Chapter Ten Wed gotten off the train in a town that could be described as anything but retro.

It sounded like the name of a town out of a movie Id watched, but I knew that wasnt where the reference came from.

We made our way through the town to a lookout that previewed Canary Wharf.

No one in this town can see her.

Ellicott City is a former mill town cut into the rocky Maryland hillside.

Soon they would arrive, in long dark coats and velvety sashes, reeking of Marlboros and skunky beer and opium incense, and maybe that would lighten her thoughts, or at least take her mind off the anniversary of yet another missed year of college, yet another year stuck in this town.

This whole fucking town has gone crazy.

The town was all but deserted now, with a thousand trees to every person.

She wasnt struggling to pay rent on an apartment in the town she grew up in and had never left.

In short it was an ordinary bedroom in an ordinary town where the only weird things that ever occurred were in the heads of those who had been trapped there for too long.

Were insulated from the town by the woods, so no one can hear any ... well, screams. Screams? Melanie asked and remembered the sight of Leah snapping at Bryans neck like a pit bull. Before the mill, this was sacred hunting ground. Oh, Melanie said, finally connecting the dots.

What do we do? She imagined sweeping across cobbled streets in a dark cape ... hiding from angry villagers wielding pitchforks and torches ... whisking away virgins into the night ... rolling around on silky sheets. What did you have in mind? Melanie blushed, but Keenans face was expressionless and smooth.

He should be locked away in an abandoned abbey in England, or roaming the halls of a crumbling castle in Transylvania  anywhere but this dead-end town whose last claim to fame was the railroad.

Finally, she wound her way back to the center of town along the tracks that Keenan never got a chance to build.

The dirt road through town stretched about a mile into the hillside, where it stopped abruptly at the doorsteps of large manor homes and the Mills Farm.

She held them there a moment, then reluctantly broke away and headed into town for the first time by herself since shed changed.

Not enough for the nicest restaurant in town but enough to keep you going for a while.

The couple of weeks leading up to the fourth of July are always a festive time for the town of Greeley.

It is a bit disturbing. He glanced into her dark amber eyes, How do you cope? Well, being in city much larger than this helps, Robin answered after a moment, As far as for the look of the place, I just imagine them as one large wall of moving bio matter forming a maze.

She took her car and drove across town to the bank.

They drove to the northern edge of town where they found the house easily enough.

He has never been one for tradition if that tradition didnt involve fire. Robin got an idea and shared it with Lone Wolfe, Couldnt you use your power to scour the town for him?

There are a lot of people in this town and if I spread myself out that much it will be like drowning in an ocean of voices.

Our father will be going with but will probably bum around town while we are there.

I was going to just bum around town during the break, Lone Wolfe replied, I know Jena was keeping Angela company and keeping her from working too hard during the year.

If you werent in this town this summer, if I never met you, this would have been the worst year ever.

Its almost like someone used a Geas on me at that moment. Curtis sat down next to him, What is a Geas? Someone taking over your body and making you do something you wouldnt normally do, Jena stated, The problem with that is the only one who could do that in this town is Lone Wolfe and he was genuinely shocked that I did that.

Lone Wolfe had to take the bus from his house to the shop in down town while Angela and Jena could take her car to the store.

She was planning to eventually return to the town after she got her degree.

The watchers must have gotten to her first and she used her pre-cognition to get across town so fast.

During the time when most of the town didnt have power, we were warm and comfortable thanks to all that planning forethought of my parents.

Facial hair like lint on his chin, if the town were to put it to a vote its likely theyd motion for him to just shave it all off and stop pretending his scruff was dignified. The fuck difference does it make? The afore-described sticky with stupor escalated to a gooey, mystified squint. The legs is heavier.

The key in the engine turned, the emergency break went the way of the killer whales, wet boot met pedal, warm grill sucked cold snow The day of was nearly hereand only one man was left in town who was down on his luck enough this season to have agreed to take the velvet reins  and all for a beggarly wage of ten-eighty-five an hour Merry-corporate-fucking-Christmas, chump But for the sorry son of a bitch known as Grandad Santa, it may be too much to hope for a happy New Year.
